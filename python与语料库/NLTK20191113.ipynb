      "5: Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor ' s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .\n",
      "\n",
      "12: Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost .\n",
      "\n",
      "14: Mr . Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning ' s work for her .\n",
      "\n",
      "16: She recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood .\n",
      "\n",
      "18: She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .\n",
      "\n",
      "19: How was she to bear the change ?-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .\n",
      "\n",
      "31: Matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter ' s marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield .\n",
      "\n",
      "32: Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner , \" Poor Miss Taylor !-- I wish she were here again .\n",
      "\n",
      "35: Mr . Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ;-- and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "56: It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her .\n",
      "\n",
      "57: Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it .\n",
      "\n",
      "58: I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see .\n",
      "\n",
      "59: Whenever James goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us .\n",
      "\n",
      "102: Mr . Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .\n",
      "\n",
      "104: Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one .\n",
      "\n",
      "105: The chances are that she must be a gainer .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "110: \" But , Mr . Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "113: \" We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor ' s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor ' s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure .\n",
      "\n",
      "148: \" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others ,\" rejoined Mr . Woodhouse , understanding but in part .\n",
      "\n",
      "167: Mrs . Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best .\n",
      "\n",
      "169: They lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe .\n",
      "\n",
      "200: She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her .\n",
      "\n",
      "201: She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .\n",
      "\n",
      "203: Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs . Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ' poor Miss Taylor ,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .\n",
      "\n",
      "204: But never did she go without Mr . Woodhouse ' s giving a gentle sigh , and saying , \" Ah , poor Miss Taylor !\n",
      "\n",
      "225: Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect .\n",
      "\n",
      "228: And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will .\n",
      "\n",
      "234: Mrs . Goddard ' s school was in high repute -- and very deservedly ; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands .\n",
      "\n",
      "236: She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr . Woodhouse ' s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside .\n",
      "\n",
      "237: These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ' s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs . Weston .\n",
      "\n",
      "238: She was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated .\n",
      "\n",
      "239: As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs . Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty .\n",
      "\n",
      "247: She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .\n",
      "\n",
      "250: The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her .\n",
      "\n",
      "251: The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm .\n",
      "\n",
      "252: They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr . Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell -- very creditably , she believed -- she knew Mr . Knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect .\n",
      "\n",
      "253: _She_ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners .\n",
      "\n",
      "255: She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware .\n",
      "\n",
      "256: With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good - will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests .\n",
      "\n",
      "275: As a walking companion , Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her .\n",
      "\n",
      "278: She had ventured once alone to Randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a Harriet Smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges .\n",
      "\n",
      "279: But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs .\n",
      "\n",
      "280: Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to .\n",
      "\n",
      "282: Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith ' s being exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required .\n",
      "\n",
      "285: Two such she did not want .\n",
      "\n",
      "288: Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful .\n",
      "\n",
      "292: Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth .\n",
      "\n",
      "296: But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place .\n",
      "\n",
      "297: Emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs . Martin ' s having \" _two_ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as Mrs . Goddard ' s drawing - room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five - and - twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them Alderneys , and one a little Welch cow , a very pretty little Welch cow indeed ; and of Mrs . Martin ' s saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _her_ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer - house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea :-- a very handsome summer - house , large enough to hold a dozen people .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "298: For some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose .\n",
      "\n",
      "299: She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son ' s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr . Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs . Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever .\n",
      "\n",
      "300: With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr . Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .\n",
      "\n",
      "302: He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging .\n",
      "\n",
      "307: He had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country .\n",
      "\n",
      "310: Mrs . Martin had told her one day ( and there was a blush as she said it ,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son , and therefore she was sure , whenever he married , he would make a good husband .\n",
      "\n",
      "311: Not that she _wanted_ him to marry .\n",
      "\n",
      "317: \" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen .\n",
      "\n",
      "351: They seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it .\n",
      "\n",
      "375: The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet ' s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own .\n",
      "\n",
      "379: His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet ' s inclination .\n",
      "\n",
      "380: Harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ' s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder .\n",
      "\n",
      "443: She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr . Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr . Elton very agreeable .\n",
      "\n",
      "448: The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency .\n",
      "\n",
      "450: He had a comfortable home for her , and Emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "451: She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet ' s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy .\n",
      "\n",
      "453: He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with :-- but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin ' s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr . Elton ' s admiration .\n",
      "\n",
      "474: \" Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old .\n",
      "\n",
      "475: I have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule .\n",
      "\n",
      "476: The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now .\n",
      "\n",
      "484: At ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen .\n",
      "\n",
      "486: And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all .\n",
      "\n",
      "487: In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her .\n",
      "\n",
      "511: How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ?\n",
      "\n",
      "513: Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to .\n",
      "\n",
      "517: How well she looked last night !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "533: Mr . Knightley , is not she ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "537: Considering how very handsome she is , she appears to be little occupied with it ; her vanity lies another way .\n",
      "\n",
      "540: With all dear Emma ' s little faults , she is an excellent creature .\n",
      "\n",
      "542: No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "560: \" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "561: But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for .\n",
      "\n",
      "564: But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "565: \" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ,\" said Mrs . Weston , \" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr . Woodhouse ' s account .\n",
      "\n",
      "570: CHAPTER VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr . Elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for .\n",
      "\n",
      "573: He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add .\n",
      "\n",
      "575: \" You have given Miss Smith all that she required ,\" said he ; \" you have made her graceful and easy .\n",
      "\n",
      "576: She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "590: said she : \" did you ever sit for your picture ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "593: No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed , \" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be !\n",
      "\n",
      "621: But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "622: Harriet was soon back again , and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others .\n",
      "\n",
      "626: She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to .\n",
      "\n",
      "627: She played and sang ;-- and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of .\n",
      "\n",
      "628: She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved .\n",
      "\n",
      "640: I should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet .\n",
      "\n",
      "656: No husbands and wives ,\" with so interesting a consciousness , that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once .\n",
      "\n",
      "657: But as she wanted to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little longer .\n",
      "\n",
      "659: It was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like Mr . John Knightley ' s , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece .\n",
      "\n",
      "670: The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day ' s sketch to wish to go on .\n",
      "\n",
      "671: There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr . Elton ' s very promising attachment was likely to add .\n",
      "\n",
      "677: \" Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted ,\"-- observed Mrs . Weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover .--\" The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes .\n",
      "\n",
      "678: It is the fault of her face that she has them not .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "686: Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr . Elton warmly added , \" Oh no !\n",
      "\n",
      "688: Consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know .\n",
      "\n",
      "696: The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "712: \" He was too good !-- she could not endure the thought !-- she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world ,\"-- brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances ,-- and a very few minutes settled the business .\n",
      "\n",
      "713: Mr . Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough .\n",
      "\n",
      "722: Harriet had been at Hartfield , as usual , soon after breakfast ; and , after a time , had gone home to return again to dinner : she returned , and sooner than had been talked of , and with an agitated , hurried look , announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell .\n",
      "\n",
      "724: She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs . Goddard ' s , that Mr . Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr . Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage .\n",
      "\n",
      "726: She was so surprized she did not know what to do .\n",
      "\n",
      "727: Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so .\n",
      "\n",
      "728: And he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do .--\" Emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful .\n",
      "\n",
      "729: \" Upon my word ,\" she cried , \" the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking .\n",
      "\n",
      "781: For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say , \" I lay it down as a general rule , Harriet , that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him .\n",
      "\n",
      "782: If she can hesitate as to ' Yes ,' she ought to say ' No ' directly .\n",
      "\n",
      "807: she cried , looking aghast .\n",
      "\n",
      "822: A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "832: The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .\n",
      "\n",
      "840: Some time afterwards it was , \" I think Mrs . Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened .\n",
      "\n",
      "845: As to any thing superior for you , I suppose she is quite in the dark .\n",
      "\n",
      "849: The idea of Mr . Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected Mr . Martin .\n",
      "\n",
      "850: \" Now he has got my letter ,\" said she softly .\n",
      "\n",
      "863: For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present .\n",
      "\n",
      "864: She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs . Goddard ' s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days .\n",
      "\n",
      "865: While she was gone , Mr . Knightley called , and sat some time with Mr . Woodhouse and Emma , till Mr . Woodhouse , who had previously made up his mind to walk out , was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , and was induced by the entreaties of both , though against the scruples of his own civility , to leave Mr . Knightley for that purpose .\n",
      "\n",
      "881: \" I cannot rate her beauty as you do ,\" said he ; \" but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition .\n",
      "\n",
      "882: Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "885: You have cured her of her school - girl ' s giggle ; she really does you credit .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "891: She has been gone longer already than she intended .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "905: Mr . Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr . Elton looked up to him .\n",
      "\n",
      "925: Now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs . Goddard ' s to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "928: Was not she the whole day with you ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "929: \" Come ,\" said she , \" I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me .\n",
      "\n",
      "931: This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and Mr . Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said , \" Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her .\n",
      "\n",
      "957: At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her .\n",
      "\n",
      "958: She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all .\n",
      "\n",
      "974: They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; Mr . Martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society .-- The sphere in which she moves is much above his .-- It would be a degradation .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "976: \" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense .\n",
      "\n",
      "977: She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up .-- There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune .-- Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort .-- That she is a gentleman ' s daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen ' s daughters , no one , I apprehend , will deny .-- She is superior to Mr . Robert Martin .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "979: After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs . Goddard ' s hands to shift as she can ;-- to move , in short , in Mrs . Goddard ' s line , to have Mrs . Goddard ' s acquaintance .\n",
      "\n",
      "985: If she has it now , you have given it .\n",
      "\n",
      "992: It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion ; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again .\n",
      "\n",
      "995: She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly .\n",
      "\n",
      "996: Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice .\n",
      "\n",
      "1002: cried she playfully .\n",
      "\n",
      "1007: Were you , yourself , ever to marry , she is the very woman for you .\n",
      "\n",
      "1008: And is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ?\n",
      "\n",
      "1011: You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her .\n",
      "\n",
      "1014: Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl .\n",
      "\n",
      "1017: Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at Mrs . Goddard ' s all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other ,) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master ' s son .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1020: But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , I think , as must prevent any second application .\n",
      "\n",
      "1022: His appearance is so much against him , and his manner so bad , that if she ever were disposed to favour him , she is not now .\n",
      "\n",
      "1023: I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him .\n",
      "\n",
      "1024: He was the brother of her friends , and he took pains to please her ; and altogether , having seen nobody better ( that must have been his great assistant ) she might not , while she was at Abbey - Mill , find him disagreeable .\n",
      "\n",
      "1031: She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable .\n",
      "\n",
      "1059: The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness ; and when Harriet appeared , and in very good spirits , and without having any such reason to give for her long absence , she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind , and convinced her , that let Mr . Knightley think or say what he would , she had done nothing which woman ' s friendship and woman ' s feelings would not justify .\n",
      "\n",
      "1060: He had frightened her a little about Mr . Elton ; but when she considered that Mr . Knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr . Knightley ' s pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about .\n",
      "\n",
      "1061: He certainly might have heard Mr . Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr . Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr . Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives .\n",
      "\n",
      "1062: Mr . Knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to Mr . Elton .\n",
      "\n",
      "1063: Harriet ' s cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of Mr . Martin , but to talk of Mr . Elton .\n",
      "\n",
      "1064: Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight .\n",
      "\n",
      "1067: Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr . Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , \" that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom Mr . Elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr . Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1069: He was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven .\n",
      "\n",
      "1075: It was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet ' s fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot - pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies .\n",
      "\n",
      "1085: Mr . Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked .\n",
      "\n",
      "1086: He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips .\n",
      "\n",
      "1090: said she ; \" that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1175: But she was not wanted to speak .\n",
      "\n",
      "1178: \" There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment ,\" said she , \" that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr . Elton ' s intentions .\n",
      "\n",
      "1192: -- and \" Dear Miss Woodhouse ,\" was all that Harriet , with many tender embraces could articulate at first ; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation , it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw , felt , anticipated , and remembered just as she ought .\n",
      "\n",
      "1219: How little did I think !-- The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured .\n",
      "\n",
      "1238: \" It is one thing ,\" said she , presently -- her cheeks in a glow --\" to have very good sense in a common way , like every body else , and if there is any thing to say , to sit down and write a letter , and say just what you must , in a short way ; and another , to write verses and charades like this .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1262: \" I shall never let that book go out of my own hands ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "1280: She read it to him , just as he liked to have any thing read , slowly and distinctly , and two or three times over , with explanations of every part as she proceeded -- and he was very much pleased , and , as she had foreseen , especially struck with the complimentary conclusion .\n",
      "\n",
      "1298: The name makes me think of poor Isabella ; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama .\n",
      "\n",
      "1302: yes -- she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has ;-- and there is the nursery for the children ,-- just as usual , you know .\n",
      "\n",
      "1304: \" I do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here !-- not since last Easter , and then only for a few days .-- Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "1305: John Knightley ' s being a lawyer is very inconvenient .-- Poor Isabella !-- she is sadly taken away from us all !-- and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1308: I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1310: \" Yes , my dear , if there is time .-- But --( in a very depressed tone )-- she is coming for only one week .\n",
      "\n",
      "1324: Unwelcome as it was , Mr . Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter ' s attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them .\n",
      "\n",
      "1325: \" Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here .\n",
      "\n",
      "1326: I am sure she will be pleased with the children .\n",
      "\n",
      "1328: I wonder which she will think the handsomest , Henry or John ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1329: \" Aye , I wonder which she will .\n",
      "\n",
      "1353: Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up .\n",
      "\n",
      "1357: He re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it -- \" Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "1377: Harriet , she found , had never in her life been within side the Vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , Emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with Mr . Elton ' s seeing ready wit in her .\n",
      "\n",
      "1378: \" I wish we could contrive it ,\" said she ; \" but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in ;-- no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1406: This does not apply , however , to Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor .\n",
      "\n",
      "1407: Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind : I really believe , if she had only a shilling in the world , she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it ; and nobody is afraid of her : that is a great charm .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1421: yes ; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury .\n",
      "\n",
      "1424: at least , that I should ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together , as she does about Jane Fairfax .\n",
      "\n",
      "1426: Every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month .\n",
      "\n",
      "1427: I wish Jane Fairfax very well ; but she tires me to death .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1431: In the present instance , it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit ; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice , she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet , as they walked away , \" These are the sights , Harriet , to do one good .\n",
      "\n",
      "1436: \" And really , I do not think the impression will soon be over ,\" said Emma , as she crossed the low hedge , and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path through the cottage garden , and brought them into the lane again .\n",
      "\n",
      "1455: Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could , she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath , a little raised on one side of the lane , leaving them together in the main road .\n",
      "\n",
      "1456: But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet ' s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her .\n",
      "\n",
      "1457: This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute .\n",
      "\n",
      "1458: They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield .\n",
      "\n",
      "1459: To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her .\n",
      "\n",
      "1460: She gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child ' s pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them .\n",
      "\n",
      "1461: Mr . Elton was speaking with animation , Harriet listening with a very pleased attention ; and Emma , having sent the child on , was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more , when they both looked around , and she was obliged to join them .\n",
      "\n",
      "1462: Mr . Elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday ' s party at his friend Cole ' s , and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese , the north Wiltshire , the butter , the cellery , the beet - root , and all the dessert .\n",
      "\n",
      "1467: \" Part of my lace is gone ,\" said she , \" and I do not know how I am to contrive .\n",
      "\n",
      "1472: She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that Mr . Elton should close it .\n",
      "\n",
      "1473: It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room .\n",
      "\n",
      "1474: For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "1482: Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event .\n",
      "\n",
      "1485: The coming of her sister ' s family was so very near at hand , that first in anticipation , and then in reality , it became henceforth her prime object of interest ; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected -- she did not herself expect -- that any thing beyond occasional , fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers .\n",
      "\n",
      "1495: She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over - careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own Mr . Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr . Perry .\n",
      "\n",
      "1500: He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "1504: Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella ' s sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father .\n",
      "\n",
      "1509: They had not been long seated and composed when Mr . Woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter ' s attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last .\n",
      "\n",
      "1511: \" Oh yes , sir ,\" cried she with ready sympathy , \" how you must miss her !\n",
      "\n",
      "1512: And dear Emma , too !-- What a dreadful loss to you both !-- I have been so grieved for you .-- I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her .-- It is a sad change indeed .-- But I hope she is pretty well , sir .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1533: \" Why , to be sure ,\" said Mr . Woodhouse --\" yes , certainly -- I cannot deny that Mrs . Weston , poor Mrs . Weston , does come and see us pretty often -- but then -- she is always obliged to go away again .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1534: \" It would be very hard upon Mr . Weston if she did not , papa .-- You quite forget poor Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "1539: As for Isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr . Westons aside as much as she can .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1573: Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr . Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass .\n",
      "\n",
      "1576: Emma ' s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr . Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation .\n",
      "\n",
      "1581: Concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to Hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt ' s arms .\n",
      "\n",
      "1583: Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby , \" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces .\n",
      "\n",
      "1589: \" A material difference then ,\" she replied --\" and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1594: Tell your aunt , little Emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1595: \" That ' s true ,\" she cried --\" very true .\n",
      "\n",
      "1615: Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr . Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself ;-- and two basins only were ordered .\n",
      "\n",
      "1685: And she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella ' s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax ; and Jane Fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising .\n",
      "\n",
      "1688: What happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt , when she comes to visit them !\n",
      "\n",
      "1689: I always regret excessively on dear Emma ' s account that she cannot be more at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , I suppose Colonel and Mrs . Campbell will not be able to part with her at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "1696: The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable ;-- but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin .\n",
      "\n",
      "1697: Often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable .\n",
      "\n",
      "1703: And for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it , and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel .\n",
      "\n",
      "1719: Emma ' s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law ' s breaking out .\n",
      "\n",
      "1733: CHAPTER XIII There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs . John Knightley , in this short visit to Hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "1740: The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr . Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs . Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house .\n",
      "\n",
      "1742: She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : Mrs . Goddard was full of care and affection , Mr . Perry was talked of , and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears .\n",
      "\n",
      "1743: Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs . Goddard ' s unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr . Elton ' s would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much .\n",
      "\n",
      "1744: She had not advanced many yards from Mrs . Goddard ' s door , when she was met by Mr . Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid -- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield -- they were overtaken by Mr . John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for .\n",
      "\n",
      "1746: Emma was just describing the nature of her friend ' s complaint ;--\" a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c . and she was sorry to find from Mrs . Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1753: Emma , who was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs . Goddard ' s experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards -- as if quite another subject , \" It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr . and Mrs . Weston .\n",
      "\n",
      "1757: \" You do quite right ,\" said she ;--\" we will make your apologies to Mr . and Mrs .\n",
      "\n",
      "1759: But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr . Elton ' s only objection , and Mr . Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction .\n",
      "\n",
      "1761: \" Well ,\" said she to herself , \" this is most strange !-- After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind !-- Most strange indeed !-- But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination -- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with Mr . Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he cannot refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked .\n",
      "\n",
      "1764: Soon afterwards Mr . Elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs . Goddard ' s for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour .\n",
      "\n",
      "1773: she replied with a smile of astonishment , \" are you imagining me to be Mr . Elton ' s object ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1781: Mr . Elton and I are very good friends , and nothing more ;\" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel .\n",
      "\n",
      "1792: Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the \" Very true , my love ,\" which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "1793: She could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence .\n",
      "\n",
      "1797: Mr . Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her .\n",
      "\n",
      "1799: \" _My_ report from Mrs . Goddard ' s ,\" said she presently , \" was not so pleasant as I had hoped --' Not better ' was _my_ answer .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1803: Very much grieved and concerned -- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1828: At another time Emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at Mr . Elton ' s spirits for other feelings .\n",
      "\n",
      "1840: Mr . Elton must smile less , and Mr . John Knightley more , to fit them for the place .-- Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was .\n",
      "\n",
      "1842: Mr . Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "1844: This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day ' s visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half - hour ; but the very sight of Mrs . Weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to Emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr . Elton ' s oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost .\n",
      "\n",
      "1849: Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of \" Can it really be as my brother imagined ?\n",
      "\n",
      "1852: For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet ' s , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr . Elton ' s nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to .\n",
      "\n",
      "1853: She heard enough to know that Mr . Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words \" my son ,\" and \" Frank ,\" and \" my son ,\" repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr . Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward .\n",
      "\n",
      "1855: She had frequently thought -- especially since his father ' s marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _were_ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition .\n",
      "\n",
      "1858: That Mr . and Mrs . Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations .\n",
      "\n",
      "1859: With such sensations , Mr . Elton ' s civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "1869: and Mrs . Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him , that she must be almost as happy as yourself .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1870: \" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off .\n",
      "\n",
      "1871: She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do .\n",
      "\n",
      "1877: I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she cannot calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1881: I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body , except herself : but she has always been kind to him ( in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices , and expecting every thing to be as she likes ).\n",
      "\n",
      "1882: And it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though I would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1883: Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs . Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy -- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming .-- Mrs . Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : \" for I cannot depend upon his coming .\n",
      "\n",
      "1897: What a blessing , that she never had any children !\n",
      "\n",
      "1898: Poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1899: Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs . Weston .\n",
      "\n",
      "1900: She should then have heard more : Mrs . Weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge .\n",
      "\n",
      "1916: A young _woman_ , if she fall into bad hands , may be teazed , and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with ; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_ ' s being under such restraint , as not to be able to spend a week with his father , if he likes it .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1919: \" But she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite .\n",
      "\n",
      "1920: Now , according to my idea of Mrs . Churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1924: \" He may have a great deal of influence on some points ,\" continued Mrs . Weston , \" and on others , very little : and among those , on which she is beyond his reach , it is but too likely , may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1932: \" Did she know ?-- had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls ?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1934: But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet ' s -- more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint .\n",
      "\n",
      "1935: He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr . Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her .\n",
      "\n",
      "1938: and she had difficulty in behaving with temper .\n",
      "\n",
      "1939: He turned to Mrs . Weston to implore her assistance , \" Would not she give him her support ?-- would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs . Goddard ' s till it were certain that Miss Smith ' s disorder had no infection ?\n",
      "\n",
      "1940: He could not be satisfied without a promise -- would not she give him her influence in procuring it ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1947: Emma saw Mrs . Weston ' s surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose .\n",
      "\n",
      "1948: She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention .\n",
      "\n",
      "1960: He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house .\n",
      "\n",
      "1965: The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them .\n",
      "\n",
      "1966: \" You had better order the carriage directly , my love ,\" said she ; \" I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk .\n",
      "\n",
      "1994: It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one .\n",
      "\n",
      "1995: But now , she would rather it had not happened .\n",

      "1997: To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded , and Mr . Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .\n",
      "\n",
      "2001: Angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak .\n",
      "\n",
      "2003: Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied , \" I am very much astonished , Mr . Elton .\n",
      "\n",
      "2006: \" Miss Smith !-- message to Miss Smith !-- What could she possibly mean !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2007: -- And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness , \" Mr . Elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct !\n",
      "\n",
      "2012: As she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied , \" It is impossible for me to doubt any longer .\n",
      "\n",
      "2018: cried Mr . Elton , \" what can be the meaning of this ?-- Miss Smith !-- I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend .\n",
      "\n",
      "2019: If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed !-- Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "2034: As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings -- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared ,) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent .\n",
      "\n",
      "2049: The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield .\n",
      "\n",
      "2050: There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of -- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr . John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself .-- But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .\n",
      "\n",
      "2051: CHAPTER XVI The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable .-- It was a wretched business indeed !-- Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for !-- Such a development of every thing most unwelcome !-- Such a blow for Harriet !-- that was the worst of all .\n",
      "\n",
      "2052: Every part of it brought pain and humiliation , of some sort or other ; but , compared with the evil to Harriet , all was light ; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken -- more in error -- more disgraced by mis - judgment , than she actually was , could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "2055: How she could have been so deceived !-- He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet -- never !\n",
      "\n",
      "2056: She looked back as well as she could ; but it was all confusion .\n",
      "\n",
      "2057: She had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it .\n",
      "\n",
      "2058: His manners , however , must have been unmarked , wavering , dubious , or she could not have been so misled .\n",
      "\n",
      "2062: Certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet ' s friend .\n",
      "\n",
      "2063: To Mr . John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility .\n",
      "\n",
      "2065: She remembered what Mr . Knightley had once said to her about Mr . Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr . Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "2066: It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr . Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others .\n",
      "\n",
      "2070: He wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for .\n",
      "\n",
      "2072: Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance ; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions , or fancy any tone of voice , less allied with real love .\n",
      "\n",
      "2077: The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior .\n",
      "\n",
      "2080: If _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _he_ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers .\n",
      "\n",
      "2085: \" Here have I ,\" said she , \" actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man .\n",
      "\n",
      "2086: She might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if I had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him .\n",
      "\n",
      "2093: I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ;-- William Coxe -- Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "2096: The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet , and all that poor Harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully .\n",
      "\n",
      "2099: Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "2102: The weather was most favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could not go to church .\n",
      "\n",
      "2103: Mr . Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas .\n",
      "\n",
      "2104: The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner .\n",
      "\n",
      "2106: It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr . Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them ,-- \" Ah !\n",
      "\n",
      "2113: The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and Mr . Woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella ;-- which poor Isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness .\n",
      "\n",
      "2118: Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded .\n",
      "\n",
      "2119: She had not even a share in his opening compliments .-- Her name was not mentioned ;-- and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father ' s suspicion .\n",
      "\n",
      "2124: She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman ' s return .\n",
      "\n",
      "2125: She went to Mrs . Goddard ' s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was .-- She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred -- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks .\n",
      "\n",
      "2126: The confession completely renewed her first shame -- and the sight of Harriet ' s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again .\n",
      "\n",
      "2131: Her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma ' s eyes -- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do .\n",
      "\n",
      "2132: It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life .\n",
      "\n",
      "2135: Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr . Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet ' s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr . Elton ' s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them .\n",
      "\n",
      "2136: Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness -- and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force .\n",
      "\n",
      "2137: If Mr . Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet ' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him .\n",
      "\n",
      "2141: Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs . Goddard ' s ; Mr . Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth .\n",
      "\n",
      "2142: Where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "2152: She wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship .\n",
      "\n",
      "2154: She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt , of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry ; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the gala - day to Highbury entire , which the sight of him would have made ; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr . Knightley ; and , to her great amusement , perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion , and making use of Mrs . Weston ' s arguments against herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "2226: It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission .\n",
      "\n",
      "2227: Had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come I dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no .\n",
      "\n",
      "2229: Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ?\n",
      "\n",
      "2254: \" He is a person I never think of from one month ' s end to another ,\" said Mr . Knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made Emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry .\n",
      "\n",
      "2255: To take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another .\n",
      "\n",
      "2257: She could not think that Harriet ' s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- \" Mr . Elton is so good to the poor !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2258: she found something else must be done .\n",
      "\n",
      "2261: There was always sufficient reason for such an attention ; Mrs . and Miss Bates loved to be called on , and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her , as rather negligent in that respect , and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts .\n",
      "\n",
      "2262: She had had many a hint from Mr . Knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable ,-- a waste of time -- tiresome women -- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of Highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them .\n",
      "\n",
      "2263: But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing , as she proposed it to Harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax .\n",
      "\n",
      "2265: Mrs . and Miss Bates occupied the drawing - room floor ; and there , in the very moderate - sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter , almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after Mr . Woodhouse ' s health , cheerful communications about her mother ' s , and sweet - cake from the beaufet --\" Mrs . Cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2268: Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ' ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet ' s being obliged to say a word .\n",
      "\n",
      "2269: This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties .\n",
      "\n",
      "2270: She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr . Elton ; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles , to usher in a letter from her niece .\n",
      "\n",
      "2272: yes -- Mr . Elton , I understand -- certainly as to dancing -- Mrs . Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was -- Mrs . Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , Jane is so very great a favourite there .\n",
      "\n",
      "2273: Whenever she is with us , Mrs . Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can .\n",
      "\n",
      "2274: And so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ' I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ;' and when I immediately said , ' But indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning ,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized .\n",
      "\n",
      "2276: said she ; ' well , that is quite unexpected .\n",
      "\n",
      "2277: Do let me hear what she says .'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2280: I hope she is well ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2286: I was reading it to Mrs . Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ;-- but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half .\n",
      "\n",
      "2288: She often says , when the letter is first opened , ' Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work '-- don ' t you , ma ' am ?-- And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her -- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word .\n",
      "\n",
      "2289: And , indeed , though my mother ' s eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God !\n",
      "\n",
      "2293: Jane often says , when she is here , ' I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too !-- I only wish my eyes may last me as well .'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2297: My mother does not hear ; she is a little deaf you know .\n",
      "\n",
      "2302: By only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice .\n",
      "\n",
      "2303: But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me .\n",
      "\n",
      "2305: However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother ' s time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here .\n",
      "\n",
      "2314: I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury , as they can be to see her .\n",
      "\n",
      "2315: Yes , Friday or Saturday ; she cannot say which , because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days .\n",
      "\n",
      "2319: That is what she writes about .\n",
      "\n",
      "2325: My mother is so delighted !-- for she is to be three months with us at least .\n",
      "\n",
      "2326: Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you .\n",
      "\n",
      "2329: They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane ' s letter -- wrote in Mr . Dixon ' s name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in Dublin , and take them back to their country seat , Baly - craig , a beautiful place , I fancy .\n",
      "\n",
      "2330: Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr . Dixon , I mean -- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs . Campbell were very particular about their daughter ' s not walking out often with only Mr . Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "2333: At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma ' s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr . Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery , \" You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time .\n",
      "\n",
      "2341: Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit -- ( I can never think of it without trembling !)\n",
      "\n",
      "2346: \" Yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and Colonel and Mrs . Campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2360: She never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us .\n",
      "\n",
      "2362: so considerate !-- But however , she is so far from well , that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home , and try an air that always agrees with her ; and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her -- and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here , than go to Ireland , if she is unwell .\n",
      "\n",
      "2365: \" And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday , and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following -- as you will find from Jane ' s letter .\n",
      "\n",
      "2373: However , when I read on , I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first ; and I make so light of it now to her , that she does not think much about it .\n",
      "\n",
      "2378: Well , now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2384: She regained the street -- happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax ' s letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself .\n",
      "\n",
      "2388: By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations .\n",
      "\n",
      "2393: He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane ' s age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .\n",
      "\n",
      "2395: The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible .\n",
      "\n",
      "2400: Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with .\n",
      "\n",
      "2403: It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over .\n",
      "\n",
      "2407: This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning .\n",
      "\n",
      "2409: With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever .\n",
      "\n",
      "2414: She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter ' s marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort .\n",
      "\n",
      "2416: It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else .\n",
      "\n",
      "2417: Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr . Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence .\n",
      "\n",
      "2418: Emma was sorry ;-- to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months !-- to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought !\n",
      "\n",
      "2419: Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr . Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her .\n",
      "\n",
      "2420: But \" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker !-- and she was made such a fuss with by every body !-- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2421: These were her reasons -- she had no better .\n",
      "\n",
      "2422: It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating .\n",
      "\n",
      "2423: Jane Fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance .\n",
      "\n",
      "2425: Emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face -- her features -- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty .\n",
      "\n",
      "2426: Her eyes , a deep grey , with dark eye - lashes and eyebrows , had never been denied their praise ; but the skin , which she had been used to cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom .\n",
      "\n",
      "2427: It was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it :-- elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury .\n",
      "\n",
      "2429: In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer .\n",
      "\n",
      "2430: When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "2431: In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on .\n",
      "\n",
      "2435: Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her .\n",
      "\n",
      "2437: Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr . Knightley , \" She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2440: The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane ' s offences rose again .\n",
      "\n",
      "2444: Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing .\n",
      "\n",
      "2446: If any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "2480: An arch look expressed --\" I understand you well enough ;\" but she said only , \" Miss Fairfax is reserved .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2481: \" I always told you she was -- a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence .\n",
      "\n",
      "2492: Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick .\n",
      "\n",
      "2493: However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs . Bates too , in a different way .\n",
      "\n",
      "2495: She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr . Knightley , because she had Emma .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2496: \" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2524: Emma had not had time even to think of Mr . Elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound .\n",
      "\n",
      "2536: for the very moment Mr . Cole told Mrs . Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me .\n",
      "\n",
      "2553: said Emma , as soon as she could speak .\n",
      "\n",
      "2560: said Miss Bates , joyfully ; \" my mother is so pleased !-- she says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress .\n",
      "\n",
      "2565: \" No -- I have never seen Mr . Elton ,\" she replied , starting on this appeal ; \" is he -- is he a tall man ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2570: \" Very true , Miss Woodhouse , so she will .\n",
      "\n",
      "2573: His extreme attention to my mother -- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick .\n",
      "\n",
      "2575: He fancied bathing might be good for it -- the warm bath -- but she says it did him no lasting benefit .\n",
      "\n",
      "2617: I shall just go round by Mrs . Cole ' s ; but I shall not stop three minutes : and , Jane , you had better go home directly -- I would not have you out in a shower !-- We think she is the better for Highbury already .\n",
      "\n",
      "2619: I shall not attempt calling on Mrs . Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "2625: Emma , alone with her father , had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry -- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject .\n",
      "\n",
      "2626: It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news , as proving that Mr . Elton could not have suffered long ; but she was sorry for Harriet : Harriet must feel it -- and all that she could hope was , by giving the first information herself , to save her from hearing it abruptly from others .\n",
      "\n",
      "2627: It was now about the time that she was likely to call .\n",
      "\n",
      "2628: If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way !-- and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation .\n",
      "\n",
      "2632: As the blow was given , Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and Harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell .\n",
      "\n",
      "2633: \" She had set out from Mrs . Goddard ' s half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to Hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford ' s .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2634: -- Ford ' s was the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper , and haberdasher ' s shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place .--\" And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in -- to be sure it was so very odd !-- but they always dealt at Ford ' s -- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother !-- Dear Miss Woodhouse !\n",
      "\n",
      "2639: I am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and I kept sitting near the door !-- Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "2645: -- for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would .\n",
      "\n",
      "2646: She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble !-- I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind !\n",
      "\n",
      "2660: The young man ' s conduct , and his sister ' s , seemed the result of real feeling , and she could not but pity them .\n",
      "\n",
      "2662: But she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ?\n",
      "\n",
      "2667: She exerted herself , and did try to make her comfortable , by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle , and quite unworthy of being dwelt on , \" It might be distressing , for the moment ,\" said she ; \" but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never -- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2668: Harriet said , \" very true ,\" and she \" would not think about it ;\" but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else ; and Emma , at last , in order to put the Martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry on the news , which she had meant to give with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused , at such a state of mind in poor Harriet -- such a conclusion of Mr . Elton ' s importance with her !\n",
      "\n",
      "2670: Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before , or an hour before , its interest soon increased ; and before their first conversation was over , she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity , wonder and regret , pain and pleasure , as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins , which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy .\n",
      "\n",
      "2675: A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins ' s name was first mentioned in Highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when Mr . Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her Christian name , and say whose music she principally played .\n",
      "\n",
      "2684: She was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again .\n",
      "\n",
      "2694: _What_ she was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the 10 , 000 l ., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet ' s superior .\n",
      "\n",
      "2697: Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath ; but Bristol was her home , the very heart of Bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained -- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived .\n",
      "\n",
      "2701: Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all !\n",
      "\n",
      "2703: she was not so easily to be talked out of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "2705: He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her .\n",
      "\n",
      "2708: she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr . Elton .\n",
      "\n",
      "2711: She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr . Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her .\n",
      "\n",
      "2717: Harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till Mr . Elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess .\n",
      "\n",
      "2722: It must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance !-- After much thinking , she could determine on nothing better , than Harriet ' s returning the visit ; but in a way that , if they had understanding , should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance .\n",
      "\n",
      "2723: She meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the Abbey Mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future .\n",
      "\n",
      "2728: She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour .\n",
      "\n",
      "2735: They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time -- till just at last , when Mrs . Martin ' s saying , all of a sudden , that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner .\n",
      "\n",
      "2736: In that very room she had been measured last September , with her two friends .\n",
      "\n",
      "2741: Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago !-- Emma could not but picture it all , and feel how justly they might resent , how naturally Harriet must suffer .\n",
      "\n",
      "2744: They were so deserving , that a _little_ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise ?-- Impossible !-- She could not repent .\n",
      "\n",
      "2745: They must be separated ; but there was a great deal of pain in the process -- so much to herself at this time , that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation , and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it .\n",
      "\n",
      "2751: And she leaned back in the corner , to indulge her murmurs , or to reason them away ; probably a little of both -- such being the commonest process of a not ill - disposed mind .\n",
      "\n",
      "2752: Presently the carriage stopt ; she looked up ; it was stopt by Mr . and Mrs . Weston , who were standing to speak to her .\n",
      "\n",
      "2758: To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy .\n",
      "\n",
      "2760: The worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment ' s thought , she hoped Mr . Elton would now be talked of no more .\n",
      "\n",
      "2761: Mr . Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated .\n",
      "\n",
      "2763: Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife .\n",
      "\n",
      "2764: \" We had better move on , Mr . Weston ,\" said she , \" we are detaining the girls .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2770: When she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to Harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .\n",
      "\n",
      "2774: The morning of the interesting day arrived , and Mrs . Weston ' s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten , or eleven , or twelve o ' clock , that she was to think of her at four .\n",
      "\n",
      "2775: \" My dear , dear anxious friend ,\"-- said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , \" always overcareful for every body ' s comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2776: The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall .\n",
      "\n",
      "2780: They had been arrived only a few minutes , and Mr . Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank ' s being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure .\n",
      "\n",
      "2781: The Frank Churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her -- he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _very_ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father ' s ; he looked quick and sensible .\n",
      "\n",
      "2782: She felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be .\n",
      "\n",
      "2796: On his side were the inquiries ,--\" Was she a horsewoman ?-- Pleasant rides ?-- Pleasant walks ?-- Had they a large neighbourhood ?-- Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough ?-- There were several very pretty houses in and about it .-- Balls -- had they balls ?-- Was it a musical society ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2797: But when satisfied on all these points , and their acquaintance proportionably advanced , he contrived to find an opportunity , while their two fathers were engaged with each other , of introducing his mother - in - law , and speaking of her with so much handsome praise , so much warm admiration , so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father , and her very kind reception of himself , as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please -- and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her .\n",
      "\n",
      "2798: He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs . Weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter .\n",
      "\n",
      "2809: She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable .\n",
      "\n",
      "2811: His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening .\n",
      "\n",
      "2823: True , true , you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she is .\n",
      "\n",
      "2830: You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on .\n",
      "\n",
      "2833: \" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance ,\" said Emma ; \" she is a very elegant young woman .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2835: \" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before ,\" said she , \" I think you will to - day .\n",
      "\n",
      "2836: You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2850: -- Highbury , with Mrs . Weston , stood for Hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him .\n",
      "\n",
      "2855: But on seeing them together , she became perfectly satisfied .\n",
      "\n",
      "2891: \" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2915: Miss Fairfax must already have given her account .-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2917: you answer as discreetly as she could do herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "2918: But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2924: \" You know Miss Fairfax ' s situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2935: \" You forget how much she belongs to Highbury .\n",
      "\n",
      "2953: Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2955: It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2962: But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr . Dixon , one may guess what one chuses .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2965: But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2966: \" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate ,-- that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends .\n",
      "\n",
      "2968: I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set .\n",
      "\n",
      "2978: He perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike , Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting .\n",
      "\n",
      "2979: He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected .\n",
      "\n",
      "2992: There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand ; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve .\n",
      "\n",
      "2993: It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday .\n",
      "\n",
      "2997: Mrs . Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether .\n",
      "\n",
      "2998: He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect .\n",
      "\n",
      "3001: He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly .\n",
      "\n",
      "3007: She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant ' s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass .\n",
      "\n",
      "3009: Something occurred while they were at Hartfield , to make Emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave .\n",
      "\n",
      "3016: Nothing should tempt _her_ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father ' s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish .\n",
      "\n",
      "3018: This lesson , she very much feared , they would receive only from herself ; she had little hope of Mr . Knightley , none of Mr . Weston .\n",
      "\n",
      "3019: But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared , that when the insult came at last , it found her very differently affected .\n",
      "\n",
      "3021: She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept .\n",
      "\n",
      "3027: It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that \" of course it must be declined ,\" she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful .\n",
      "\n",
      "3028: She owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party .\n",
      "\n",
      "3031: Upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly Mrs . Goddard , if not Mrs . Bates , might be depended on for bearing him company -- Mr . Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter ' s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him .\n",
      "\n",
      "3089: She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort .\n",
      "\n",
      "3091: He did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual .\n",
      "\n",
      "3103: Her father ' s comfort was amply secured , Mrs . Bates as well as Mrs . Goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal .-- She had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it .\n",
      "\n",
      "3106: \" This is coming as you should do ,\" said she ; \" like a gentleman .-- I am quite glad to see you .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3119: She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please , and given all the consequence she could wish for .\n",
      "\n",
      "3120: When the Westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side .\n",
      "\n",
      "3123: The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of Jane Fairfax .\n",
      "\n",
      "3127: Mrs . Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand , but a large - sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on Miss Bates ' s , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood ' s the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by Miss Bates ' s account , Jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it -- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter ;-- of course it must be from Colonel Campbell .\n",
      "\n",
      "3139: said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "3168: Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment .\n",
      "\n",
      "3175: Did you ever hear of that ?-- A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard .\n",
      "\n",
      "3191: She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them .\n",
      "\n",
      "3202: Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend ; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace , she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner , but could most heartily rejoice in that light , cheerful , unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure , in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection .\n",
      "\n",
      "3203: There she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding ?\n",
      "\n",
      "3205: Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr . Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend .\n",
      "\n",
      "3207: She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte , she felt too much in the secret herself , to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair , and therefore purposely kept at a distance ; but by the others , the subject was almost immediately introduced , and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received , the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of \" my excellent friend Colonel Campbell .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3208: Mrs . Weston , kind - hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine ' s countenance .\n",
      "\n",
      "3215: And she , \" Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "3219: He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining - room -- hated sitting long -- was always the first to move when he could -- that his father , Mr . Knightley , Mr . Cox , and Mr . Cole , were left very busy over parish business -- that as long as he had staid , however , it had been pleasant enough , as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike , sensible men ; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether -- thought it so abundant in agreeable families -- that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much .\n",
      "\n",
      "3225: He had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "3237: When Mr . Cole had moved away , and her attention could be restored as before , she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax , who was sitting exactly opposite .\n",
      "\n",
      "3239: said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "3245: Shall I ?-- Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it ;-- whether she colours .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3246: He was gone immediately ; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of Miss Fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing .\n",
      "\n",
      "3248: \" This is the luxury of a large party ,\" said she :--\" one can get near every body , and say every thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "3258: And as I looked at her , though I never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold .\n",
      "\n",
      "3263: she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure .\n",
      "\n",
      "3291: \" Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3315: ' Not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong .'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3324: The interest he takes in her -- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospect !\n",
      "\n",
      "3342: Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs . Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr . Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .\n",
      "\n",
      "3343: She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well .\n",
      "\n",
      "3347: They sang together once more ; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own .\n",
      "\n",
      "3348: With mixed feelings , she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument , to listen .\n",
      "\n",
      "3351: But the sight of Mr . Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma ' s mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs . Weston ' s suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions .\n",
      "\n",
      "3355: A real injury to the children -- a most mortifying change , and material loss to them all ;-- a very great deduction from her father ' s daily comfort -- and , as to herself , she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey .\n",
      "\n",
      "3361: His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for Mrs . Weston , it would not have struck her .\n",
      "\n",
      "3362: As a sort of touchstone , however , she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece ; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short , she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own .\n",
      "\n",
      "3363: \" I often feel concern ,\" said she , \" that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions .\n",
      "\n",
      "3366: And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step .\n",
      "\n",
      "3367: \" This present from the Campbells ,\" said she --\" this pianoforte is very kindly given .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3386: Miss Bates , in her real anxiety for Jane , could hardly stay even to be grateful , before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing .\n",
      "\n",
      "3389: While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off , Emma found time , in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste , to look about , and see what became of Mr . Knightley .\n",
      "\n",
      "3395: Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry ; his interest was yet safe ; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment .\n",
      "\n",
      "3396: Not more than five couple could be mustered ; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful , and she found herself well matched in a partner .\n",
      "\n",
      "3404: The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity .\n",
      "\n",
      "3406: Perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy .\n",
      "\n",
      "3407: She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax ' s feelings to Frank Churchill .\n",
      "\n",
      "3408: It was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .\n",
      "\n",
      "3409: The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax ; and there she had no doubt .\n",
      "\n",
      "3412: She was then interrupted by Harriet ' s coming in ; and if Harriet ' s praise could have satisfied her , she might soon have been comforted .\n",
      "\n",
      "3419: I think you play quite as well as she does .\n",
      "\n",
      "3424: \" Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out .\n",
      "\n",
      "3429: I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste .\n",
      "\n",
      "3432: Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach .\n",
      "\n",
      "3433: The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family .\n",
      "\n",
      "3443: I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3451: Harriet , tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word , was always very long at a purchase ; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind , Emma went to the door for amusement .-- Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury ;-- Mr . Perry walking hastily by , Mr . William Cox letting himself in at the office - door , Mr . Cole ' s carriage - horses returning from exercise , or a stray letter - boy on an obstinate mule , were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect ; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray , a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket , two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone , and a string of dawdling children round the baker ' s little bow - window eyeing the gingerbread , she knew she had no reason to complain , and was amused enough ; quite enough still to stand at the door .\n",
      "\n",
      "3456: Mrs . Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses , in order to hear the new instrument .\n",
      "\n",
      "3457: \" For my companion tells me ,\" said she , \" that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "3467: Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me .\n",
      "\n",
      "3468: My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping .\n",
      "\n",
      "3469: She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same .\n",
      "\n",
      "3488: Emma watched them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter ,-- trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern .\n",
      "\n",
      "3518: then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party , she cannot refuse .--' Aye , pray do ,' said Mr . Frank Churchill , ' Miss Woodhouse ' s opinion of the instrument will be worth having .'\n",
      "\n",
      "3523: At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping .\n",
      "\n",
      "3528: Only three of us .-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .\n",
      "\n",
      "3529: I dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off .\n",
      "\n",
      "3530: But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr . Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street .\n",
      "\n",
      "3543: said she , beginning again when they were all in the street .\n",
      "\n",
      "3544: Emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix .\n",
      "\n",
      "3578: But I was really quite shocked the other day -- for Mr . Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock .\n",
      "\n",
      "3583: And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me -- No , I should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left .\n",
      "\n",
      "3616: He contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again .\n",
      "\n",
      "3617: That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again .\n",
      "\n",
      "3634: She could not but hear ; she could not avoid answering , \" Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell ,\" said she , in a voice of forced calmness , \" I can imagine nothing with any confidence .\n",
      "\n",
      "3656: Emma wished he would be less pointed , yet could not help being amused ; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile , when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness , there had been a smile of secret delight , she had less scruple in the amusement , and much less compunction with respect to her .-- This amiable , upright , perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings .\n",
      "\n",
      "3659: \" I hope she does .\n",
      "\n",
      "3666: If she does wrong , she ought to feel it .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3675: She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke , and opening the casement there , immediately called Mr . Knightley ' s attention , and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others , as if it had passed within the same apartment .\n",
      "\n",
      "3682: How is Miss Fairfax ?-- I hope she caught no cold last night .\n",
      "\n",
      "3683: How is she to - day ?\n",
      "\n",
      "3693: Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3756: But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr . Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .\n",
      "\n",
      "3770: Gilbert would have danced the other evening , if she had been asked .\n",
      "\n",
      "3800: \" No , no ,\" said she , \" you are quite unreasonable .\n",
      "\n",
      "3808: Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest .\n",
      "\n",
      "3809: Had she intended ever to _marry_ him , it might have been worth while to pause and consider , and try to understand the value of his preference , and the character of his temper ; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance , he was quite amiable enough .\n",
      "\n",
      "3879: I hope whenever poor Isabella ' s little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3885: Emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown .\n",
      "\n",
      "3886: There were Mr . and Mrs . Weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect .\n",
      "\n",
      "3887: \" Emma ,\" said she , \" this paper is worse than I expected .\n",
      "\n",
      "3922: \" Well -- if you please ,\" said Mrs . Weston rather hesitating , \" if you think she will be of any use .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3924: \" She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing .\n",
      "\n",
      "3927: \" But she is so amusing , so extremely amusing !\n",
      "\n",
      "3951: Long before he reappeared , attending the short , neat , brisk - moving aunt , and her elegant niece ,-- Mrs . Weston , like a sweet - tempered woman and a good wife , had examined the passage again , and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before -- indeed very trifling ; and here ended the difficulties of decision .\n",
      "\n",
      "3956: Most cordially , when Miss Bates arrived , did she agree that it must .\n",
      "\n",
      "3957: As a counsellor she was not wanted ; but as an approver , ( a much safer character ,) she was truly welcome .\n",
      "\n",
      "3962: CHAPTER XII One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma -- its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill ' s stay in Surry ; for , in spite of Mr . Weston ' s confidence , she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight .\n",
      "\n",
      "3975: It made her animated -- open hearted -- she voluntarily said ;-- \" Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "3980: No !-- she was more and more convinced that Mrs . Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise .\n",
      "\n",
      "3986: Mrs . Churchill was unwell -- far too unwell to do without him ; she had been in a very suffering state ( so said her husband ) when writing to her nephew two days before , though from her usual unwillingness to give pain , and constant habit of never thinking of herself , she had not mentioned it ; but now she was too ill to trifle , and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay .\n",
      "\n",
      "3995: and she and her partner the happiest !--\" I said it would be so ,\" was the only consolation .\n",
      "\n",
      "3997: He thought principally of Mrs . Churchill ' s illness , and wanted to know how she was treated ; and as for the ball , it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed ; but they would all be safer at home .\n",
      "\n",
      "4033: She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in .\n",
      "\n",
      "4038: It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not wish .\n",
      "\n",
      "4039: Forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said , \" You are quite in the right ; it was most natural to pay your visit , then \"-- He was silent .\n",
      "\n",
      "4040: She believed he was looking at her ; probably reflecting on what she had said , and trying to understand the manner .\n",
      "\n",
      "4054: the blessing of a female correspondent , when one is really interested in the absent !-- she will tell me every thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "4063: What strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to , was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration , a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion , joined to all the rest , made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him , in spite of every previous determination against it .\n",
      "\n",
      "4064: \" I certainly must ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "4072: It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax , to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change ; but when they did meet , her composure was odious .\n",
      "\n",
      "4073: She had been particularly unwell , however , suffering from headache to a degree , which made her aunt declare , that had the ball taken place , she did not think Jane could have attended it ; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill - health .\n",
      "\n",
      "4076: At first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little .\n",
      "\n",
      "4077: She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of ; and , for his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr . and Mrs . Weston ; she was very often thinking of him , and quite impatient for a letter , that she might know how he was , how were his spirits , how was his aunt , and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring .\n",
      "\n",
      "4078: But , on the other hand , she could not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after the first morning , to be less disposed for employment than usual ; she was still busy and cheerful ; and , pleasing as he was , she could yet imagine him to have faults ; and farther , though thinking of him so much , and , as she sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_ .\n",
      "\n",
      "4081: When she became sensible of this , it struck her that she could not be very much in love ; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father , never to marry , a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings .\n",
      "\n",
      "4082: \" I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_ ,\" said she .-- \" In not one of all my clever replies , my delicate negatives , is there any allusion to making a sacrifice .\n",
      "\n",
      "4088: Upon the whole , she was equally contented with her view of his feelings .\n",
      "\n",
      "4094: When his letter to Mrs . Weston arrived , Emma had the perusal of it ; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations , and think she had undervalued their strength .\n",
      "\n",
      "4097: _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than once , and never without a something of pleasing connexion , either a compliment to her taste , or a remembrance of what she had said ; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye , unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry , she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed .\n",
      "\n",
      "4103: Gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to Mrs . Weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her .\n",
      "\n",
      "4108: \" I must not dwell upon it ,\" said she .--\" I must not think of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "4116: She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr . Elton ; and Harriet ' s mind , she had been willing to hope , had been lately gaining strength .\n",
      "\n",
      "4117: With Mr . Weston ' s ball in view at least , there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things ; but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach -- new carriage , bell - ringing , and all .\n",
      "\n",
      "4119: Emma felt that she could not do too much for her , that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience ; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect , for ever agreed to , without being able to make their opinions the same .\n",
      "\n",
      "4120: Harriet listened submissively , and said \" it was very true -- it was just as Miss Woodhouse described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer \" but no change of subject could avail , and the next half - hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before .\n",
      "\n",
      "4135: The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably .\n",
      "\n",
      "4138: Such expressions , assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do , made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly before .\n",
      "\n",
      "4139: \" There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart ,\" said she afterwards to herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "4147: CHAPTER XIV Mrs . Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "4148: Emma had feelings , less of curiosity than of pride or propriety , to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects ; and she made a point of Harriet ' s going with her , that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible .\n",
      "\n",
      "4149: She could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _recollecting_ .\n",
      "\n",
      "4151: Compliments , charades , and horrible blunders ; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too ; but she behaved very well , and was only rather pale and silent .\n",
      "\n",
      "4154: She would not be in a hurry to find fault , but she suspected that there was no elegance ;-- ease , but not elegance .-- She was almost sure that for a young woman , a stranger , a bride , there was too much ease .\n",
      "\n",
      "4157: As for Mr . Elton , his manners did not appear -- but no , she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners .\n",
      "\n",
      "4159: The woman was better off ; she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr . Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be .\n",
      "\n",
      "4160: \" Well , Miss Woodhouse ,\" said Harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ; \" Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh ,) what do you think of her ?-- Is not she very charming ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4168: no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all .-- A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4169: \" I dare say ,\" returned Harriet , sighing again , \" I dare say she was very much attached to him .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4170: \" Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man ' s fate to marry the woman who loves him best .\n",
      "\n",
      "4171: Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4172: \" Yes ,\" said Harriet earnestly , \" and well she might , nobody could ever have a better .\n",
      "\n",
      "4183: From Harriet ' s happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father ' s being present to engage Mr . Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady ' s conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs . Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr . Elton no good .\n",
      "\n",
      "4185: If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set .\n",
      "\n",
      "4189: Mrs . Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room , the entrance , and all that she could see or imagine .\n",
      "\n",
      "4201: Emma made as slight a reply as she could ; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs . Elton , who only wanted to be talking herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "4233: Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to Bristol , ' I really cannot get this girl to move from the house .\n",
      "\n",
      "4235: Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion .\n",
      "\n",
      "4252: She restrained herself , however , from any of the reproofs she could have given , and only thanked Mrs . Elton coolly ; \" but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4286: Selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly .\n",
      "\n",
      "4293: \" We have been calling at Randalls ,\" said she , \" and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be .\n",
      "\n",
      "4298: Emma was almost too much astonished to answer ; but Mrs . Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on .\n",
      "\n",
      "4300: But she is really quite the gentlewoman .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4305: The tone implied some old acquaintance -- and how could she possibly guess ?\n",
      "\n",
      "4324: And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club !\n",
      "\n",
      "4340: -- All this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the Eltons ' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending .\n",
      "\n",
      "4341: \" Well , my dear ,\" he deliberately began , \" considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you .\n",
      "\n",
      "4345: However , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife .\n",
      "\n",
      "4372: Such as Mrs . Elton appeared to her on this second interview , such she appeared whenever they met again ,-- self - important , presuming , familiar , ignorant , and ill - bred .\n",
      "\n",
      "4373: She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs . Elton ' s consequence only could surpass .\n",
      "\n",
      "4376: He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of Miss Bates ' s good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that Mrs . Elton ' s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being \" very pleasant and very elegantly dressed .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4377: In one respect Mrs . Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first .\n",
      "\n",
      "4378: Her feelings altered towards Emma .-- Offended , probably , by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with , she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant ; and though the effect was agreeable , the ill - will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma ' s dislike .\n",
      "\n",
      "4384: Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other , but from the very first ; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration -- but without solicitation , or plea , or privilege , she must be wanting to assist and befriend her .-- Before Emma had forfeited her confidence , and about the third time of their meeting , she heard all Mrs . Elton ' s knight - errantry on the subject .-- \" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse .-- I quite rave about Jane Fairfax .-- A sweet , interesting creature .\n",
      "\n",
      "4385: So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents !-- I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents .\n",
      "\n",
      "4386: I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well .\n",
      "\n",
      "4389: she is absolutely charming !\n",
      "\n",
      "4396: but dear Miss Woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away .-- Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end !\n",
      "\n",
      "4397: And I think she feels it .\n",
      "\n",
      "4398: I am sure she does .\n",
      "\n",
      "4400: One can see that she feels the want of encouragement .\n",
      "\n",
      "4415: I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating .-- I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4421: Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me !-- But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman ' s tongue !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4423: The change on Mrs . Elton ' s side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs . Elton , nor , under Mrs . Elton ' s guidance , the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done .\n",
      "\n",
      "4426: Emma ' s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs . Elton as she seemed to do .\n",
      "\n",
      "4430: said she .--\" To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort !\n",
      "\n",
      "4434: Would Jane but go , means were to be found , servants sent , friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist ; but still she had declined it !\n",
      "\n",
      "4439: But why must she consent to be with the Eltons ?-- Here is quite a separate puzzle .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4441: \" We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma -- but it is better than being always at home .\n",
      "\n",
      "4443: We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4445: Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her .\n",
      "\n",
      "4446: But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs . Elton , which nobody else pays her .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4447: Emma felt that Mrs . Weston was giving her a momentary glance ; and she was herself struck by his warmth .\n",
      "\n",
      "4448: With a faint blush , she presently replied , \" Such attentions as Mrs . Elton ' s , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax .\n",
      "\n",
      "4452: Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said , \" Another thing must be taken into consideration too -- Mrs . Elton does not talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her .\n",
      "\n",
      "4453: We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted .\n",
      "\n",
      "4456: And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs . Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs . Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to .\n",
      "\n",
      "4461: \" And yet ,\" said Emma , beginning hastily and with an arch look , but soon stopping -- it was better , however , to know the worst at once -- she hurried on --\" And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is .\n",
      "\n",
      "4484: Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault .\n",
      "\n",
      "4485: \" Well ,\" said she , \" and you soon silenced Mr . Cole , I suppose ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4490: I wonder how she speaks of the Coles -- what she calls them !\n",
      "\n",
      "4491: How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ?\n",
      "\n",
      "4492: She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr . Cole ?\n",
      "\n",
      "4497: I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4500: She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be -- And I love an open temper .\n",
      "\n",
      "4507: Dinner - parties and evening - parties were made for him and his lady ; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day .\n",
      "\n",
      "4508: \" I see how it is ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "4517: Mrs . Bates , Mrs . Perry , Mrs . Goddard and others , were a good deal behind - hand in knowledge of the world , but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged .\n",
      "\n",
      "4518: In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card - tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order .\n",
      "\n",
      "4520: They must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment .\n",
      "\n",
      "4525: \" She would rather not be in his company more than she could help .\n",
      "\n",
      "4527: If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4528: It was precisely what Emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing .\n",
      "\n",
      "4529: She was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend -- for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home ; and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth , Jane Fairfax .-- Since her last conversation with Mrs . Weston and Mr . Knightley , she was more conscience - stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been .-- Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "4532: \" This is very true ,\" said she , \" at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful .-- Of the same age -- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend .-- She will never like me now .\n",
      "\n",
      "4540: She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself , by representing that though he certainly would make them nine , yet he always said so little , that the increase of noise would be very immaterial .\n",
      "\n",
      "4552: \" I went only to the post - office ,\" said she , \" and reached home before the rain was much .\n",
      "\n",
      "4594: Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold .\n",
      "\n",
      "4608: she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again ,\" eagerly rejoined Mrs . Elton .\n",
      "\n",
      "4623: Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered ; but instead of answering , she began speaking again to Mr . John Knightley .\n",
      "\n",
      "4625: said she .-- \" The regularity and despatch of it !\n",
      "\n",
      "4655: No , she had heard from him very lately , but having answered the letter , had put it away .\n",
      "\n",
      "4663: Elton , before she could be spoken to , was ready ; and before Mr . Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining - parlour , was saying -- \" Must I go first ?\n",
      "\n",
      "4669: She could have made an inquiry or two , as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails ;-- it was at her tongue ' s end -- but she abstained .\n",
      "\n",
      "4674: If Jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half - whisper , especially on Mrs . Elton ' s side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects : The post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of Mrs . Elton ' s meditated activity .\n",
      "\n",
      "4676: said she , \" I get quite anxious about you .\n",
      "\n",
      "4688: A cousin of Mr . Suckling , Mrs . Bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle .\n",
      "\n",
      "4722: In this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr . Woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and Emma heard her saying in the same half - whisper to Jane , \" Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest !-- Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men !-- what a dear creature he is ;-- I assure you I like him excessively .\n",
      "\n",
      "4758: She was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy .\n",
      "\n",
      "4760: _She_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable .\n",
      "\n",
      "4761: Mr . Weston , however , too eager to be very observant , too communicative to want others to talk , was very well satisfied with what she did say , and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already .\n",
      "\n",
      "4763: They were the first entitled , after Mrs . Weston and Emma , to be made happy ;-- from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs . Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her .\n",
      "\n",
      "4781: Elton .-- This letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs . Churchill ' s account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her -- so they are all to move southward without loss of time .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4791: In Frank ' s last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle ' s !\n",
      "\n",
      "4792: This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road .-- So Frank writes word .\n",
      "\n",
      "4808: \" Is not she ?\n",
      "\n",
      "4809: Then she is no rule for Mrs . Churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4810: Mrs . Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly .\n",
      "\n",
      "4811: It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it ;-- and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when Mr . Weston went on .\n",
      "\n",
      "4814: Besides , she is out of health now ; but _that_ indeed , by her own account , she has always been .\n",
      "\n",
      "4816: \" If she is really ill , why not go to Bath , Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "4819: The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe .\n",
      "\n",
      "4820: She has now been a longer time stationary there , than she ever was before , and she begins to want change .\n",
      "\n",
      "4827: Or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life .\n",
      "\n",
      "4868: If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish .\n",
      "\n",
      "4871: Frank ' s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her .\n",
      "\n",
      "4873: And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood .\n",
      "\n",
      "4874: She was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out - Churchill ' d them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , I assure you , she is an upstart .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4890: The remaining five were left to their own powers , and Emma doubted their getting on very well ; for Mr . Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; Mrs . Elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination to pay , and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent .\n",
      "\n",
      "4921: And as to my dear little boys , I must say , that if Aunt Emma has not time for them , I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one -- and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4924: She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him .\n",
      "\n",
      "4928: She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration .\n",
      "\n",
      "4930: and yet , she could not help rather anticipating something decisive .\n",
      "\n",
      "4932: It was not very long , though rather longer than Mr . Weston had foreseen , before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill ' s feelings .\n",
      "\n",
      "4934: He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act .\n",
      "\n",
      "4937: But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done , of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree .\n",
      "\n",
      "4942: It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference .\n",
      "\n",
      "4946: She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long .\n",
      "\n",
      "4952: That she was really ill was very certain ; he had declared himself convinced of it , at Randalls .\n",
      "\n",
      "4953: Though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago .\n",
      "\n",
      "4954: He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove , or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her ; but he could not be prevailed on , by all his father ' s doubts , to say that her complaints were merely imaginary , or that she was as strong as ever .\n",
      "\n",
      "4991: Mr . Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man ' s company .\n",
      "\n",
      "4996: she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help Mr . Weston ' s judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection .\n",
      "\n",
      "5005: \" I think she must be here soon ,\" said he .\n",
      "\n",
      "5007: It cannot be long , I think , before she comes .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5021: Mr . Weston was following ; but Mrs . Elton detained him , to gratify him by her opinion of his son ; and so briskly did she begin , that the young man himself , though by no means moving slowly , could hardly be out of hearing .\n",
      "\n",
      "5030: While she talked of his son , Mr . Weston ' s attention was chained ; but when she got to Maple Grove , he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry away .\n",
      "\n",
      "5037: As the door opened she was heard , \" So very obliging of you !-- No rain at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "5041: And Jane declares -- Well !--( as soon as she was within the door ) Well !\n",
      "\n",
      "5048: I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance .\n",
      "\n",
      "5074: Does not she , Jane ?-- Do not we often talk of Mr . Frank Churchill ?-- Ah !\n",
      "\n",
      "5077: Quite wonderful how she does her hair !-- No hairdresser from London I think could .-- Ah !\n",
      "\n",
      "5095: Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs . Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her .-- He was thoughtful .\n",
      "\n",
      "5096: Whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine .\n",
      "\n",
      "5117: It had just occurred to Mrs . Weston that Mrs . Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction .-- Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude .\n",
      "\n",
      "5122: Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs . Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .\n",
      "\n",
      "5124: Mrs . Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change .\n",
      "\n",
      "5125: Mr . Weston might be his son ' s superior .-- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her .-- She was more disturbed by Mr . Knightley ' s not dancing than by any thing else .-- There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing ,-- not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up ,-- so young as he looked !-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "5126: His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body ' s eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him .-- He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble .-- Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave .\n",
      "\n",
      "5128: She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .\n",
      "\n",
      "5137: He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room .\n",
      "\n",
      "5141: She was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all .\n",
      "\n",
      "5142: When she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but Mr . Elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs . Weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by significant glances .-- The kind - hearted , gentle Mrs . Weston had left her seat to join him and say , \" Do not you dance , Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "5154: Mrs . Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat .\n",
      "\n",
      "5159: Her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot .\n",
      "\n",
      "5160: In another moment a happier sight caught her ;-- Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set !-- Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant .\n",
      "\n",
      "5161: She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again .\n",
      "\n",
      "5162: His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced .\n",
      "\n",
      "5163: It was not thrown away on her , she bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the middle , and was in a continual course of smiles .\n",
      "\n",
      "5170: She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage , though every thing has been done -- One door nailed up -- Quantities of matting -- My dear Jane , indeed you must .\n",
      "\n",
      "5175: Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr . Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon .-- Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners .\n",
      "\n",
      "5177: said I , ' I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr . George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr . Elton , I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr . William Cox .'\n",
      "\n",
      "5180: Upon my word , Jane on one arm , and me on the other !-- Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs . Elton is going ; dear Mrs . Elton , how elegant she looks !-- Beautiful lace !-- Now we all follow in her train .\n",
      "\n",
      "5189: Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus -- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned !-- Well , this is brilliant !\n",
      "\n",
      "5233: It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy .-- She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying .\n",
      "\n",
      "5234: The impertinence of the Eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of Harriet ' s infatuation .-- From Harriet ' s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had strong hopes .\n",
      "\n",
      "5235: It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that Mr . Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him .\n",
      "\n",
      "5241: Having arranged all these matters , looked them through , and put them all to rights , she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys , as well as of their grandpapa , when the great iron sweep - gate opened , and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together -- Frank Churchill , with Harriet leaning on his arm -- actually Harriet !-- A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened .\n",
      "\n",
      "5249: She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing , and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless -- and in this state , and exceedingly terrified , she had been obliged to remain .\n",
      "\n",
      "5250: How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word .-- More and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill .-- She was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more .\n",
      "\n",
      "5251: In this state Frank Churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent .\n",
      "\n",
      "5257: This was the amount of the whole story ,-- of his communication and of Harriet ' s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech .-- He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs . Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr . Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "5260: Could a linguist , could a grammarian , could even a mathematician have seen what she did , have witnessed their appearance together , and heard their history of it , without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other ?-- How much more must an imaginist , like herself , be on fire with speculation and foresight !-- especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made .\n",
      "\n",
      "5262: Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind ;-- and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her !-- It certainly was very extraordinary !-- And knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more .\n",
      "\n",
      "5263: He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering from her mania for Mr . Elton .\n",
      "\n",
      "5266: In the few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with him , while Harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after Harriet ' s own account had been given , he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms .\n",
      "\n",
      "5269: No , she had had enough of interference .\n",
      "\n",
      "5272: Beyond it she would on no account proceed .\n",
      "\n",
      "5273: Emma ' s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed ,-- aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion : but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible .\n",
      "\n",
      "5278: It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ), as well as Miss Smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent -- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and Harriet not much otherwise , Emma would not interfere with .\n",
      "\n",
      "5279: She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition was ; and if he did not invent illnesses for her , she could make no figure in a message .\n",
      "\n",
      "5281: The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews :-- in her imagination it maintained its ground , and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital .\n",
      "\n",
      "5285: \" It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish ,\" she continued , \" to have no reserves with you on this subject .\n",
      "\n",
      "5295: I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now .-- I do not care whether I meet him or not -- except that of the two I had rather not see him -- and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him -- but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable -- I shall never forget her look the other night !-- However , I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil .-- No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment ' s pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy -- what I ought to have destroyed long ago -- what I ought never to have kept -- I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke ).-- However , now I will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown .\n",
      "\n",
      "5297: said she , with a conscious look .\n",
      "\n",
      "5302: Harriet unfolded the parcel , and she looked on with impatience .\n",
      "\n",
      "5318: And secretly she added to herself , \" Lord bless me !\n",
      "\n",
      "5353: She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made , and could not but hope that the gipsy , though she had _told_ no fortune , might be proved to have made Harriet ' s .-- About a fortnight after the alarm , they came to a sufficient explanation , and quite undesignedly .\n",
      "\n",
      "5354: Emma was not thinking of it at the moment , which made the information she received more valuable .\n",
      "\n",
      "5355: She merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , \" Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so \"-- and thought no more of it , till after a minute ' s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone , \" I shall never marry .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5365: Should she proceed no farther ?-- should she let it pass , and seem to suspect nothing ?-- Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances , she was perfectly resolved .-- She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once , all that she meant to say and know .\n",
      "\n",
      "5367: She had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed .-- She was decided , and thus spoke -- \" Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning .\n",
      "\n",
      "5400: The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother ' s ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs . Elton ' s activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will .\n",
      "\n",
      "5413: The Randalls party agreed to it immediately ; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates , which few persons listened to , she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse ' s most obliging invitation .\n",
      "\n",
      "5426: It was owing to _her_ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm .\n",
      "\n",
      "5438: \" No , sir ,\" replied his son , laughing , \" I seem to have had it from nobody .-- Very odd !-- I really was persuaded of Mrs . Weston ' s having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream .\n",
      "\n",
      "5452: Mrs . Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed .\n",
      "\n",
      "5455: Mrs . Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of .\n",
      "\n",
      "5460: Where is she ?-- Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "5465: From Frank Churchill ' s face , where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away , he had involuntarily turned to hers ; but she was indeed behind , and too busy with her shawl .\n",
      "\n",
      "5485: If meant to be immediately mixed with the others , and buried from sight , she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across , for it was not mixed ; and Harriet , eager after every fresh word , and finding out none , directly took it up , and fell to work .\n",
      "\n",
      "5496: He saw that Emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , \" Nonsense !\n",
      "\n",
      "5513: She was immediately up , and wanting to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and Mr . Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined .\n",
      "\n",
      "5521: She could not endure to give him the true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them .\n",
      "\n",
      "5523: she cried in evident embarrassment , \" it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5526: He had hoped she would speak again , but she did not .\n",
      "\n",
      "5538: \" Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5540: she cried with a most open eagerness --\" Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me .\n",
      "\n",
      "5559: So she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off .\n",
      "\n",
      "5564: Emma had never been to Box Hill ; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing , and she and Mr . Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither .\n",
      "\n",
      "5566: This was so very well understood between them , that Emma could not but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , on hearing from Mr . Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs . Elton , as her brother and sister had failed her , that the two parties should unite , and go together ; and that as Mrs . Elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be , if she had no objection .\n",
      "\n",
      "5567: Now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs . Elton , of which Mr . Weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again :-- it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs . Elton ' s party !\n",
      "\n",
      "5574: And she is a good - natured woman after all .\n",
      "\n",
      "5581: she cried .--\" And such weather for exploring !-- These delays and disappointments are quite odious .\n",
      "\n",
      "5591: She promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it .\n",
      "\n",
      "5592: \" You may depend upon me ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "5611: \" No ,\"-- he calmly replied ,--\" there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is --\" \"-- Mrs . Weston , I suppose ,\" interrupted Mrs . Elton , rather mortified .\n",
      "\n",
      "5612: \" No -- Mrs . Knightley ;-- and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5615: she cried , satisfied to have no one preferred to herself .--\" You are a humourist , and may say what you like .\n",
      "\n",
      "5669: It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey , that as soon as she was satisfied of her father ' s comfort , she was glad to leave him , and look around her ; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation , more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family .\n",
      "\n",
      "5670: She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered -- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the Abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up .-- The house was larger than Hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms .-- It was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and Emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding .-- Some faults of temper John Knightley had ; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably .\n",
      "\n",
      "5672: These were pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did , and collect round the strawberry - beds .-- The whole party were assembled , excepting Frank Churchill , who was expected every moment from Richmond ; and Mrs . Elton , in all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and her basket , was very ready to lead the way in gathering , accepting , or talking -- strawberries , and only strawberries , could now be thought or spoken of .--\" The best fruit in England -- every body ' s favourite -- always wholesome .-- These the finest beds and finest sorts .-- Delightful to gather for one ' s self -- the only way of really enjoying them .-- Morning decidedly the best time -- never tired -- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison -- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- Chili preferred -- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in London -- abundance about Bristol -- Maple Grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule -- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit -- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries -- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer -- must go and sit in the shade .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5673: Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs . Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy .-- She had some fears of his horse .\n",
      "\n",
      "5677: Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs . Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately .-- On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend ' s negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before .-- Still Mrs . Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow ' s post .-- How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma .-- She did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal .-- \" Should not they walk ?\n",
      "\n",
      "5679: -- The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear .\n",
      "\n",
      "5684: In this walk Emma and Mr . Weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr . Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way .\n",
      "\n",
      "5685: Mr . Knightley and Harriet !-- It was an odd tete - a - tete ; but she was glad to see it .-- There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony .\n",
      "\n",
      "5687: There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm ; but now she feared it not .\n",
      "\n",
      "5696: His father would not own himself uneasy , and laughed at her fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare .\n",
      "\n",
      "5699: Churchill ' s state , however , as many were ready to remind her , was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence -- and Mrs . Weston was at last persuaded to believe , or to say , that it must be by some attack of Mrs . Churchill that he was prevented coming .-- Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration ; she behaved very well , and betrayed no emotion .\n",
      "\n",
      "5705: Mrs . Weston had been shewing them all to him , and now he would shew them all to Emma ;-- fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child , than in a total want of taste for what he saw , for he was slow , constant , and methodical .-- Before this second looking over was begun , however , Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments ' free observation of the entrance and ground - plot of the house -- and was hardly there , when Jane Fairfax appeared , coming quickly in from the garden , and with a look of escape .-- Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon , there was a start at first ; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of .\n",
      "\n",
      "5706: \" Will you be so kind ,\" said she , \" when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home ?-- I am going this moment .-- My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly .-- I have said nothing about it to any body .\n",
      "\n",
      "5720: \" I am ,\"-- she answered --\" I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me .-- Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits .\n",
      "\n",
      "5730: said Emma , as she turned back into the hall again .\n",
      "\n",
      "5734: Emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him .\n",
      "\n",
      "5746: Such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door .\n",
      "\n",
      "5817: He said nothing worth hearing -- looked without seeing -- admired without intelligence -- listened without knowing what she said .\n",
      "\n",
      "5821: To amuse her , and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that he cared for -- and Emma , glad to be enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay and easy too , and gave him all the friendly encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her own estimation , meant nothing , though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe .\n",
      "\n",
      "5824: Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity ; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected .\n",
      "\n",
      "5825: She laughed because she was disappointed ; and though she liked him for his attentions , and thought them all , whether in friendship , admiration , or playfulness , extremely judicious , they were not winning back her heart .\n",
      "\n",
      "5864: Ladies and gentlemen , I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse ( who , wherever she is , presides ) to say , that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5867: \" Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5869: no , no \"-- cried Emma , laughing as carelessly as she could -- \" Upon no account in the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "5881: Ladies and gentlemen -- I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way .\n",
      "\n",
      "5882: Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already ,) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever -- or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5895: Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr . Knightley ,) and I will try to hold my tongue .\n",
      "\n",
      "5896: I must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5982: There she is -- no , that ' s somebody else .\n",
      "\n",
      "5987: Such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again .\n",
      "\n",
      "5988: While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr . Knightley by her side .\n",
      "\n",
      "5996: I dare say she did not understand me .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5997: \" I assure you she did .\n",
      "\n",
      "6000: I wish you could have heard how she talked of it -- with what candour and generosity .\n",
      "\n",
      "6001: I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6004: \" They are blended ,\" said he , \" I acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good .\n",
      "\n",
      "6005: Were she a woman of fortune , I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner .\n",
      "\n",
      "6006: Were she your equal in situation -- but , Emma , consider how far this is from being the case .\n",
      "\n",
      "6007: She is poor ; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to ; and , if she live to old age , must probably sink more .\n",
      "\n",
      "6010: You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _some_ ,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her .-- This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will ,-- I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6011: While they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in .\n",
      "\n",
      "6014: She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late .\n",
      "\n",
      "6017: She was vexed beyond what could have been expressed -- almost beyond what she could conceal .\n",
      "\n",
      "6018: Never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life .\n",
      "\n",
      "6022: How could she have been so brutal , so cruel to Miss Bates !\n",
      "\n",
      "6023: How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued !\n",
      "\n",
      "6026: As she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more .\n",
      "\n",
      "6031: How it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell .\n",
      "\n",
      "6032: They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed .\n",
      "\n",
      "6034: _There_ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach .\n",
      "\n",
      "6035: As a daughter , she hoped she was not without a heart .\n",
      "\n",
      "6038: If attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven .\n",
      "\n",
      "6041: In the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse .\n",
      "\n",
      "6043: It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr . Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit .\n",
      "\n",
      "6046: Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not .\n",
      "\n",
      "6050: She heard Miss Bates ' s voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon .\n",
      "\n",
      "6052: Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , \" Well , my dear , I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6053: Poor old Mrs . Bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on .\n",
      "\n",
      "6054: \" I am afraid Jane is not very well ,\" said she , \" but I do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well .\n",
      "\n",
      "6060: I am sure she will be here presently .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6061: Emma seriously hoped she would .\n",
      "\n",
      "6064: A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings .\n",
      "\n",
      "6068: This does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me --( twinkling away a tear or two )-- but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning :-- such long letters , you know , to be written to Colonel Campbell , and Mrs . Dixon .\n",
      "\n",
      "6071: It is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , I suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , Miss Woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune --( again dispersing her tears )-- but , poor dear soul !\n",
      "\n",
      "6072: if you were to see what a headache she has .\n",
      "\n",
      "6075: To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation .\n",
      "\n",
      "6076: You will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room -- I want her to lie down upon the bed .\n",
      "\n",
      "6077: ' My dear ,' said I , ' I shall say you are laid down upon the bed :' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "6078: But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well .\n",
      "\n",
      "6083: ' Well ,' said she , ' it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .'\n",
      "\n",
      "6087: -- ' I can see nobody ,' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were .\n",
      "\n",
      "6090: Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs . Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "6091: She spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude -- sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for Miss Fairfax ' s advantage and comfort as possible .\n",
      "\n",
      "6104: She would not let Jane say , ' No ;' for when Jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at Donwell ,) when Jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell ' s return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told Mrs . Elton over and over again -- and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind !-- but that good Mrs . Elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than I did .\n",
      "\n",
      "6105: It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane ' s answer ; but she positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go .\n",
      "\n",
      "6107: I had not the least idea !-- Jane took Mrs . Elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs . Smallridge ' s situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it .-- I did not know a word of it till it was all settled .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6112: ' You _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us ,' said she --' I positively must have you _all_ come .'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6114: \" No , not Mr . Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs . Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not ;-- but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had .\n",
      "\n",
      "6119: \" I dare say she had .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6136: \" Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs . Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6137: \" Yes ; Jane says she is sure they will ; but yet , this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining .\n",
      "\n",
      "6138: I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs . Elton , and when Mrs . Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it !\n",
      "\n",
      "6142: Poor old John , I have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed - ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints -- I must go and see him to - day ; and so will Jane , I am sure , if she gets out at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "6147: Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr . Frank Churchill ' s going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence .\n",
      "\n",
      "6150: The contrast between Mrs . Churchill ' s importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax ' s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman ' s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates ' s saying , \" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte .\n",
      "\n",
      "6152: Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now .-- ' You must go ,' said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "6154: You will have no business here .-- Let it stay , however ,' said she ; ' give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back .\n",
      "\n",
      "6156: -- And to this day , I do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter ' s .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6157: Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave .\n",
      "\n",
      "6158: CHAPTER IX Emma ' s pensive meditations , as she walked home , were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her .\n",
      "\n",
      "6167: Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again .\n",
      "\n",
      "6172: Emma ' s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "6174: She was warmly gratified -- and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part .-- He took her hand ;-- whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say -- she might , perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips -- when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go .-- Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive .-- He would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped .-- The intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more .-- It was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature .-- She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction .\n",
      "\n",
      "6177: Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier ;-- it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax ' s situation with Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "6178: Knightley .-- Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened at a better time -- and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter .-- They parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry ;-- it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion .-- He had been sitting with them half an hour , she found .\n",
      "\n",
      "6179: It was a pity that she had not come back earlier !\n",
      "\n",
      "6180: In the hope of diverting her father ' s thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr . Knightley ' s going to London ; and going so suddenly ; and going on horseback , which she knew would be all very bad ; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax , and her dependence on the effect was justified ; it supplied a very useful check ,-- interested , without disturbing him .\n",
      "\n",
      "6182: \" I am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled .\n",
      "\n",
      "6186: You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us .\n",
      "\n",
      "6187: And I hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6190: Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return .\n",
      "\n",
      "6194: Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried .\n",
      "\n",
      "6195: Goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame .\n",
      "\n",
      "6197: In one point she was fully justified .\n",
      "\n",
      "6201: no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper .\n",
      "\n",
      "6216: What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing .\n",
      "\n",
      "6223: She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy .\n",
      "\n",
      "6228: \" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ;\" and when Mr . Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs . Smallridge ' s at the time proposed .\n",
      "\n",
      "6230: He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it .\n",
      "\n",
      "6236: To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name -- mentioning that she had Mr . Perry ' s decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient .\n",
      "\n",
      "6238: Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted .\n",
      "\n",
      "6239: In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs . Bates ' s , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her -- but it would not do ;-- Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried -- but all in vain .\n",
      "\n",
      "6240: Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse .-- Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in .\n",
      "\n",
      "6242: Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs . Eltons , the Mrs . Perrys , and the Mrs . Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece ' s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist .\n",
      "\n",
      "6245: In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but \" dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6246: When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together -- that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_ .\n",
      "\n",
      "6248: Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr . Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove .\n",
      "\n",
      "6250: -- He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father , \" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning ?-- Do , if it be possible .\n",
      "\n",
      "6253: \" Is she unwell ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6255: She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _alone_ , and that you know --( nodding towards her father )-- Humph !-- Can you come ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6259: But what can be the matter ?-- Is she really not ill ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6265: Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr . Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls .\n",
      "\n",
      "6283: Emma ' s courage returned , and she walked on .\n",
      "\n",
      "6288: Emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort .\n",
      "\n",
      "6294: said she , as they proceeded -- speaking more to assist Mr . Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view .\n",
      "\n",
      "6308: Mrs . Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma ' s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said , \" What is it my dear friend ?\n",
      "\n",
      "6333: Emma scarcely heard what was said .-- Her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet ;-- and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation .\n",
      "\n",
      "6334: \" Well ,\" said she at last , trying to recover herself ; \" this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day , before I can at all comprehend it .\n",
      "\n",
      "6341: \" That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my present perfect indifference ,\" she continued , \" I will farther tell you , that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance , when I did like him , when I was very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay , was attached -- and how it came to cease , is perhaps the wonder .\n",
      "\n",
      "6346: Mrs . Weston kissed her with tears of joy ; and when she could find utterance , assured her , that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do .\n",
      "\n",
      "6347: \" Mr . Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "6375: They burst on him , I do not know how , but by some letter or message -- and it was the discovery of what she was doing , of this very project of hers , which determined him to come forward at once , own it all to his uncle , throw himself on his kindness , and , in short , put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6390: While poor Mrs . Churchill lived , I suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility ;-- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required .\n",
      "\n",
      "6431: -- She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice .-- It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet ' s imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed .\n",
      "\n",
      "6434: And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them .-- She felt that she had been risking her friend ' s happiness on most insufficient grounds .\n",
      "\n",
      "6435: Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her .--\" But , with common sense ,\" she added , \" I am afraid I have had little to do .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6437: If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful .-- As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account .\n",
      "\n",
      "6438: Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure .-- Her days of insignificance and evil were over .-- She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous .-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted .\n",
      "\n",
      "6440: No doubt it had been from jealousy .-- In Jane ' s eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed .\n",
      "\n",
      "6442: She understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert .\n",
      "\n",
      "6452: In spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet , which Mrs . Weston had just gone through by herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "6453: The intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another .\n",
      "\n",
      "6454: Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet ' s footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor Mrs . Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls .\n",
      "\n",
      "6474: \" Had you any idea ,\" cried Harriet , \" of his being in love with her ?-- You , perhaps , might .-- You ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body ' s heart ; but nobody else --\" \" Upon my word ,\" said Emma , \" I begin to doubt my having any such talent .\n",
      "\n",
      "6486: what do you mean ?-- Mistake you !-- Am I to suppose then ?--\" She could not speak another word .-- Her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer .\n",
      "\n",
      "6487: Harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma ' s .\n",
      "\n",
      "6488: \" I should not have thought it possible ,\" she began , \" that you could have misunderstood me !\n",
      "\n",
      "6518: \" I do not wonder , Miss Woodhouse ,\" she resumed , \" that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body .\n",
      "\n",
      "6526: Emma ' s eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few minutes .\n",
      "\n",
      "6529: She touched -- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole truth .\n",
      "\n",
      "6535: How improperly had she been acting by Harriet !\n",
      "\n",
      "6538: It struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "6539: Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits -- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet --( there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr . Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now ,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness .-- For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet ' s hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right .-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost .-- Neither of them thought but of Mr . Knightley and themselves .\n",
      "\n",
      "6540: Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight .-- Emma ' s tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet ' s , but they were not less .\n",
      "\n",
      "6543: From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse ' s encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness !-- Latterly she had been more and more aware of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "6546: She had often observed the change , to almost the same extent .-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him -- and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet .\n",
      "\n",
      "6547: He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings .-- She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once .-- Much that lived in Harriet ' s memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma .\n",
      "\n",
      "6548: Circumstances that might swell to half an hour ' s relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself .-- The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed !--( Harriet could not recall it without a blush .)\n",
      "\n",
      "6549: He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged .-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming :-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _her_ .\n",
      "\n",
      "6551: On the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question .\n",
      "\n",
      "6557: When Harriet had closed her evidence , she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse , to say whether she had not good ground for hope .\n",
      "\n",
      "6558: \" I never should have presumed to think of it at first ,\" said she , \" but for you .\n",
      "\n",
      "6565: \" She could not compose herself -- Mr . Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go ;\"-- with most ready encouragement from her friend , therefore , she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone , this was the spontaneous burst of Emma ' s feelings : \" Oh God !\n",
      "\n",
      "6569: How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself , and living under !-- The blunders , the blindness of her own head and heart !-- she sat still , she walked about , she tried her own room , she tried the shrubbery -- in every place , every posture , she perceived that she had acted most weakly ; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree ; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying ; that she was wretched , and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness .\n",
      "\n",
      "6573: When had his influence , such influence begun ?-- When had he succeeded to that place in her affection , which Frank Churchill had once , for a short period , occupied ?-- She looked back ; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter ' s becoming known to her -- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it -- oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "6574: had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison .-- She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr . Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear .\n",
      "\n",
      "6575: She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all !\n",
      "\n",
      "6577: This was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it .-- She was most sorrowfully indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "6579: With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body ' s feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body ' s destiny .\n",
      "\n",
      "6580: She was proved to have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief .\n",
      "\n",
      "6581: She had brought evil on Harriet , on herself , and she too much feared , on Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "6582: Knightley .-- Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place , on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning ; for his attachment , she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet ' s ;-- and even were this not the case , he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly .\n",
      "\n",
      "6590: had she never brought Harriet forward !\n",
      "\n",
      "6591: Had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought !-- Had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong -- all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been .\n",
      "\n",
      "6593: Knightley !-- How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it !-- But Harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly .-- Her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt .-- She had seemed more sensible of Mr . Elton ' s being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "6596: Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self - consequence but herself ?-- Who but herself had taught her , that she was to elevate herself if possible , and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment ?-- If Harriet , from being humble , were grown vain , it was her doing too .\n",
      "\n",
      "6597: CHAPTER XII Till now that she was threatened with its loss , Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr . Knightley , first in interest and affection .-- Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been .-- Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella .\n",
      "\n",
      "6599: She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared .\n",
      "\n",
      "6600: In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear ?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .\n",
      "\n",
      "6605: How directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject !-- Not too strongly for the offence -- but far , far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear - sighted goodwill .-- She had no hope , nothing to deserve the name of hope , that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question ; but there was a hope ( at times a slight one , at times much stronger ,) that Harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his regard for _her_ .-- Wish it she must , for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself , but his remaining single all his life .\n",
      "\n",
      "6606: Could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied .-- Let him but continue the same Mr . Knightley to her and her father , the same Mr . Knightley to all the world ; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured .-- Marriage , in fact , would not do for her .\n",
      "\n",
      "6607: It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father , and with what she felt for him .\n",
      "\n",
      "6609: She would not marry , even if she were asked by Mr . Knightley .\n",
      "\n",
      "6610: It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were .-- She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here .-- He was expected back every day .\n",
      "\n",
      "6612: In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet .-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther .-- She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet ' s confidence .\n",
      "\n",
      "6613: To talk would be only to irritate .-- She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday .-- Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful .\n",
      "\n",
      "6615: Mr . Weston had accompanied her to Mrs . Bates ' s , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs . Bates ' s parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .\n",
      "\n",
      "6616: A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related .\n",
      "\n",
      "6617: Mrs . Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr . Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement ' s becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports :-- but Mr . Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for \" such things ,\" he observed , \" always got about .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6620: She had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness .\n",
      "\n",
      "6623: Miss Fairfax ' s recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs . Weston to invite her to an airing ; she had drawn back and declined at first , but , on being pressed had yielded ; and , in the course of their drive , Mrs . Weston had , by gentle encouragement , overcome so much of her embarrassment , as to bring her to converse on the important subject .\n",
      "\n",
      "6624: Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr . Weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement .\n",
      "\n",
      "6625: Mrs . Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject .\n",
      "\n",
      "6626: \" On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months ,\" continued Mrs . Weston , \" she was energetic .\n",
      "\n",
      "6633: No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "6634: ' The consequence ,' said she , ' has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought .\n",
      "\n",
      "6639: ' Do not imagine , madam ,' she continued , ' that I was taught wrong .\n",
      "\n",
      "6645: It must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement .\n",
      "\n",
      "6650: But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before .\n",
      "\n",
      "6651: One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in ,\" she said , \" was that of making her _unreasonable_ .\n",
      "\n",
      "6653: ' I did not make the allowances ,' said she , ' which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first .'\n",
      "\n",
      "6656: \" If I did not know her to be happy now ,\" said Emma , seriously , \" which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , I could not bear these thanks ;-- for , oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "6660: I am sure she is very good -- I hope she will be very happy .\n",
      "\n",
      "6663: She thought well of Frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest .\n",
      "\n",
      "6664: She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for Emma ' s attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs . Weston ended with , \" We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come ,\" she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .\n",
      "\n",
      "6673: Had she followed Mr . Knightley ' s known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now .-- Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she ?-- Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax ' s confidence on this important matter -- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane ' s feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill ' s .\n",
      "\n",
      "6674: Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst .\n",
      "\n",
      "6684: The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , no pleasures had been lost .-- But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction .\n",
      "\n",
      "6686: If all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends , Hartfield must be comparatively deserted ; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness .\n",
      "\n",
      "6693: When it came to such a pitch as this , she was not able to refrain from a start , or a heavy sigh , or even from walking about the room for a few seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was in the resolution of her own better conduct , and the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past , it would yet find her more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave her less to regret when it were gone .\n",
      "\n",
      "6697: She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on Mr . Perry ' s coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery .-- There , with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw Mr . Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her .-- It was the first intimation of his being returned from London .\n",
      "\n",
      "6703: He must have had a wet ride .-- Yes .-- He meant to walk with her , she found .\n",
      "\n",
      "6712: Yet she could not bear this silence .\n",
      "\n",
      "6719: After waiting a moment , as if to be sure she intended to say no more , he replied , \" If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6721: cried Emma , turning her glowing cheeks towards him ; for , while she spoke , it occurred to her that he might have called at Mrs . Goddard ' s in his way .\n",
      "\n",
      "6724: For a moment or two nothing was said , and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest , till she found her arm drawn within his , and pressed against his heart , and heard him thus saying , in a tone of great sensibility , speaking low , \" Time , my dearest Emma , time will heal the wound .-- Your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father ' s sake -- I know you will not allow yourself --.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6730: Emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied , \" You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right .-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion .\n",
      "\n",
      "6740: She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion .\n",
      "\n",
      "6751: She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought .\n",
      "\n",
      "6758: What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him !-- Assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax ' s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour ,-- equality of situation -- I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one -- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants .-- A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _her_ regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals .-- Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune .\n",
      "\n",
      "6765: She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr . Knightley startled her , by saying , \" You will not ask me what is the point of envy .-- You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity .-- You are wise -- but _I_ cannot be wise .\n",
      "\n",
      "6768: then , don ' t speak it , don ' t speak it ,\" she eagerly cried .\n",
      "\n",
      "6772: He was wishing to confide in her -- perhaps to consult her ;-- cost her what it would , she would listen .\n",
      "\n",
      "6773: She might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to Harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his .-- They had reached the house .\n",
      "\n",
      "6778: And , after proceeding a few steps , she added -- \" I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr . Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain .-- But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me .-- I will hear whatever you like .\n",
      "\n",
      "6795: While he spoke , Emma ' s mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word -- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet ' s hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself .-- And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet ' s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not .-- It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two -- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not .\n",
      "\n",
      "6798: Her way was clear , though not quite smooth .-- She spoke then , on being so entreated .-- What did she say ?-- Just what she ought , of course .\n",
      "\n",
      "6800: He _had_ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope ;-- she had begun by refusing to hear him .-- The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden ;-- her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary !-- She felt its inconsistency ; but Mr . Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation .\n",
      "\n",
      "6801: Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material .-- Mr . Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his .\n",
      "\n",
      "6804: He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill ' s engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her .-- The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings .\n",
      "\n",
      "6805: The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill , of her having a heart completely disengaged from him , had given birth to the hope , that , in time , he might gain her affection himself ;-- but it had been no present hope -- he had only , in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment , aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her .-- The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting .-- The affection , which he had been asking to be allowed to create , if he could , was already his !-- Within half an hour , he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind , to something so like perfect happiness , that it could bear no other name .\n",
      "\n",
      "6811: He had found her agitated and low .-- Frank Churchill was a villain .-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him .\n",
      "\n",
      "6813: CHAPTER XIV What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out !-- she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ;-- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .\n",
      "\n",
      "6814: They sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table -- how often it had been collected !-- and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun !-- But never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter .\n",
      "\n",
      "6816: As long as Mr . Knightley remained with them , Emma ' s fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy .\n",
      "\n",
      "6821: While he lived , it must be only an engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested of the danger of drawing her away , it might become an increase of comfort to him .-- How to do her best by Harriet , was of more difficult decision ;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; how to appear least her enemy ?-- On these subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great -- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it .-- She could only resolve at last , that she would still avoid a meeting with her , and communicate all that need be told by letter ; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury , and -- indulging in one scheme more -- nearly resolve , that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square .-- Isabella had been pleased with Harriet ; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement .-- She did not think it in Harriet ' s nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety , by the streets , the shops , and the children .-- At any rate , it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself , from whom every thing was due ; a separation for the present ; an averting of the evil day , when they must all be together again .\n",
      "\n",
      "6823: He had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from Randalls -- a very thick letter ;-- she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it .-- She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself -- and as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was sure she was incapable of it .-- It must be waded through , however .\n",
      "\n",
      "6837: I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement .-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad .-- But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this ?-- What did you look forward to ?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness .\n",
      "\n",
      "6843: With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation .-- A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to .-- My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought .-- In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown .-- I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on .-- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish .-- She received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me .\n",
      "\n",
      "6845: From our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so .-- Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , I cannot say ;-- when I called to take leave of her , I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth , and I then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree .-- She may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part .\n",
      "\n",
      "6855: She must tell you herself what she is -- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit .-- Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her .-- She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend .\n",
      "\n",
      "6857: I know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit .\n",
      "\n",
      "6866: I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement .-- But I had no choice .\n",
      "\n",
      "6867: The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman -- Here , my dear madam , I was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself .-- I have been walking over the country , and am now , I hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be .-- It is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me .\n",
      "\n",
      "6870: _She_ disapproved them , which ought to have been enough .-- My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient .-- She was displeased ; I thought unreasonably so : I thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : I thought her even cold .\n",
      "\n",
      "6871: But she was always right .\n",
      "\n",
      "6872: If I had followed her judgment , and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper , I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known .-- We quarrelled .-- Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell ?-- _There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis .\n",
      "\n",
      "6873: I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it .\n",
      "\n",
      "6876: While I , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless ?-- Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected .-- I was mad enough , however , to resent .-- I doubted her affection .\n",
      "\n",
      "6877: I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss W ., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me .-- In short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though I might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because I would be as angry with her as possible .\n",
      "\n",
      "6878: Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances .-- I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party .\n",
      "\n",
      "6880: Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs . Elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred .\n",
      "\n",
      "6884: I answered it within an hour ; but from the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once , my answer , instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day , was locked up in my writing - desk ; and I , trusting that I had written enough , though but a few lines , to satisfy her , remained without any uneasiness .-- I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily ; but I made excuses for her , and was too busy , and -- may I add ?-- too cheerful in my views to be captious .-- We removed to Windsor ; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her , my own letters all returned !-- and a few lines at the same time by the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding , that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible , she now sent me , by a safe conveyance , all my letters , and requested , that if I could not directly command hers , so as to send them to Highbury within a week , I would forward them after that period to her at --: in short , the full direction to Mr . Smallridge ' s , near Bristol , stared me in the face .\n",
      "\n",
      "6885: I knew the name , the place , I knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing .\n",
      "\n",
      "6886: It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy .\n",
      "\n",
      "6887: For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me .-- Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post .-- What was to be done ?-- One thing only .-- I must speak to my uncle .\n",
      "\n",
      "6895: I hope she is right .-- In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F . C . WESTON CHURCHILL .\n",
      "\n",
      "6898: As soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment .\n",
      "\n",
      "6899: She never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong , yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs . Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever .\n",
      "\n",
      "6900: She thought so well of the letter , that when Mr . Knightley came again , she desired him to read it .\n",
      "\n",
      "6905: Mr . Weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him .\n",
      "\n",
      "6927: Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet ' s account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of .\n",
      "\n",
      "6928: \" You had better go on ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "6932: A boyish scheme , indeed !-- I cannot comprehend a man ' s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with ; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument ' s coming if she could .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6940: We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6946: actually resolve to break with him entirely !-- She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each -- she dissolved it .-- What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour !-- Well , he must be a most extraordinary --\" \" Nay , nay , read on .-- You will find how very much he suffers .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6982: Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her .\n",
      "\n",
      "6992: It is remarkable , that Emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded .\n",
      "\n",
      "6993: Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt .\n",
      "\n",
      "6994: This proposal of his , this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield -- the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it became .\n",
      "\n",
      "7004: Mr . Knightley , always so kind , so feeling , so truly considerate for every body , would never deserve to be less worshipped than now ; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet , that she could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year .\n",
      "\n",
      "7009: She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella ' s invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention .-- There was a tooth amiss .\n",
      "\n",
      "7011: Mrs . John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr . Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care .-- When it was thus settled on her sister ' s side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable .-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr . Woodhouse ' s carriage .-- It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square .\n",
      "\n",
      "7012: Now Emma could , indeed , enjoy Mr . Knightley ' s visits ; now she could talk , and she could listen with true happiness , unchecked by that sense of injustice , of guilt , of something most painful , which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her , how much might at that moment , and at a little distance , be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "7013: The difference of Harriet at Mrs . Goddard ' s , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma ' s sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "7015: There was a communication before her , one which _she_ only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present .-- She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs . Weston were safe and well .\n",
      "\n",
      "7016: No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved -- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time .-- A fortnight , at least , of leisure and peace of mind , to crown every warmer , but more agitating , delight , should be hers .\n",
      "\n",
      "7017: She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax .-- She ought to go -- and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill .\n",
      "\n",
      "7018: It would be a _secret_ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate .\n",
      "\n",
      "7019: She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected .-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name .-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible .-- No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , \" Beg her to walk up ;\"-- and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient .-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging .\n",
      "\n",
      "7024: Emma could have wished Mrs . Elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as Mrs . Elton met her with unusual graciousness , she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm .\n",
      "\n",
      "7025: She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs . Elton ' s thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in Miss Fairfax ' s confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people .\n",
      "\n",
      "7026: Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs . Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ' s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods , \" We can finish this some other time , you know .\n",
      "\n",
      "7030: You see how delightfully she writes .\n",
      "\n",
      "7032: she is a sweet creature !\n",
      "\n",
      "7038: And again , on Emma ' s merely turning her head to look at Mrs . Bates ' s knitting , she added , in a half whisper , \" I mentioned no _names_ , you will observe .-- Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "7043: When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs . Weston , she found herself abruptly addressed with , \" Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered ?-- Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit ?--( here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane .)\n",
      "\n",
      "7045: if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7048: \" I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , Miss Woodhouse ,\" she shortly afterwards began , \" since the party to Box Hill .\n",
      "\n",
      "7054: Soon after this Miss Bates came in , and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself , resulting , she supposed , from doubt of what might be said , and impatience to say every thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "7055: \" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness .-- It is impossible to say -- Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane ' s prospects -- that is , I do not mean .-- But she is charmingly recovered .-- How is Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "7080: no , the meeting is certainly to - day ,\" was the abrupt answer , which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs . Elton ' s side .-- \" I do believe ,\" she continued , \" this is the most troublesome parish that ever was .\n",
      "\n",
      "7108: The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected .-- Very extraordinary !-- And nobody knew at all which way he was gone .\n",
      "\n",
      "7110: Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary , indeed , and that she had not a syllable to say for him .\n",
      "\n",
      "7118: Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly .\n",
      "\n",
      "7119: In all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and Mr . Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr . Elton , if not towards William Larkins .\n",
      "\n",
      "7120: She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say , \" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility .\n",
      "\n",
      "7151: She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of Isabella ' s sons ; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best .\n",
      "\n",
      "7153: \" She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me ,\" she continued --\" like La Baronne d ' Almane on La Comtesse d ' Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis ' Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7154: \" That is ,\" replied Mr . Knightley , \" she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "7159: She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older .\n",
      "\n",
      "7175: And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7190: I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs . Elton , by calling you Mr . K .-- But I will promise ,\" she added presently , laughing and blushing --\" I will promise to call you once by your Christian name .\n",
      "\n",
      "7192: Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith ; but it was too tender a subject .-- She could not enter on it .-- Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them .\n",
      "\n",
      "7197: Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before .-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .\n",
      "\n",
      "7199: Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .\n",
      "\n",
      "7206: \" He writes like a sensible man ,\" replied Emma , when she had read the letter .\n",
      "\n",
      "7211: He only means --\" \" He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two ,\" interrupted she , with a sort of serious smile --\" much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7213: she cried with more thorough gaiety , \" if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion .\n",
      "\n",
      "7229: As soon as Mrs . Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr . Woodhouse ' s visits , Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause , resolved first to announce it at home , and then at Randalls .-- But how to break it to her father at last !-- She had bound herself to do it , in such an hour of Mr . Knightley ' s absence , or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her , and she must have put it off ; but Mr . Knightley was to come at such a time , and follow up the beginning she was to make .-- She was forced to speak , and to speak cheerfully too .\n",
      "\n",
      "7231: She must not appear to think it a misfortune .-- With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and Mr . Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person ' s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs . Weston , best in the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "7233: She was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor Isabella , and poor Miss Taylor .-- But it would not do .\n",
      "\n",
      "7234: Emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs . Weston , whose marriages taking them from Hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from Hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr . Knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea .-- Did he not love Mr . Knightley very much ?-- He would not deny that he did , she was sure .-- Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "7239: Mrs . Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event .-- She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost .-- She had such a regard for Mr . Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago .-- How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield !\n",
      "\n",
      "7254: Was not she like a daughter , his eldest daughter ?-- he must tell her ; and Miss Bates being present , it passed , of course , to Mrs . Cole , Mrs . Perry , and Mrs . Elton , immediately afterwards .\n",
      "\n",
      "7259: Mr . Elton cared little about it , compared with his wife ; he only hoped \" the young lady ' s pride would now be contented ;\" and supposed \" she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ;\" and , on the point of living at Hartfield , could daringly exclaim , \" Rather he than I !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7265: But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day .-- Shocking plan , living together .\n",
      "\n",
      "7273: said she , quickly , looking up in his face .\n",
      "\n",
      "7284: Her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what .\n",
      "\n",
      "7299: \" You mistake me , you quite mistake me ,\" she replied , exerting herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "7306: she cried .--\" Well !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7307: -- Then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , \" Well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me .\n",
      "\n",
      "7320: To speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness .\n",
      "\n",
      "7326: He wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly -- she did -- cheerfully answering , \" You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match .\n",
      "\n",
      "7332: how peculiarly unprepared I was !-- for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7333: \" You ought to know your friend best ,\" replied Mr . Knightley ; \" but I should say she was a good - tempered , soft - hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7334: Emma could not help laughing as she answered , \" Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do .-- But , Mr . Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him .\n",
      "\n",
      "7335: I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already ?-- Did not you misunderstand him ?-- You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him ?-- It was not Harriet ' s hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7336: The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr . Knightley and Robert Martin was , at this moment , so strong to Emma ' s feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet ' s side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , \" No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin ,\" that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature .\n",
      "\n",
      "7344: \" I am quite sure ,\" he replied , speaking very distinctly , \" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so .\n",
      "\n",
      "7357: Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin ' s cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life .-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7361: She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved .\n",
      "\n",
      "7366: She was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational .\n",
      "\n",
      "7367: Her father ' s business was to announce James ' s being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing .\n",
      "\n",
      "7369: The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet ' s welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security .-- What had she to wish for ?\n",
      "\n",
      "7372: Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them .\n",
      "\n",
      "7381: In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day , or poor Mrs . Weston would be disappointed .\n",
      "\n",
      "7389: They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure .\n",
      "\n",
      "7396: \" Is not she looking well ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7398: \" Better than she ever used to do ?-- You see how my father and Mrs . Weston doat upon her .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7400: \" I can never think of it ,\" she cried , \" without extreme shame .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7430: \" If not in our dispositions ,\" she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , \" there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7435: Is not she an angel in every gesture ?\n",
      "\n",
      "7437: Observe her eyes , as she is looking up at my father .-- You will be glad to hear ( inclining his head , and whispering seriously ) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt ' s jewels .\n",
      "\n",
      "7441: \" Very beautiful , indeed ,\" replied Emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out , \" How delighted I am to see you again !\n",
      "\n",
      "7444: The others had been talking of the child , Mrs . Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant ' s appearing not quite well .\n",
      "\n",
      "7445: She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr . Perry .\n",
      "\n",
      "7446: Perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but Mr . Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself .-- In ten minutes , however , the child had been perfectly well again .\n",
      "\n",
      "7447: This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr . Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it .\n",
      "\n",
      "7457: Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane ' s countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf .\n",
      "\n",
      "7460: \" I can never think of it without laughing .-- She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse .\n",
      "\n",
      "7463: Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7464: Jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice , \" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me !-- They _will_ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7465: He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma ' s feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr . Knightley ' s high superiority of character .\n",
      "\n",
      "7467: CHAPTER XIX If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr . Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty .\n",
      "\n",
      "7468: A very few days brought the party from London , and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet , than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was !-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr . Knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness .\n",
      "\n",
      "7469: Harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend ' s approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations .-- Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley ' s , and the dinner the next day ; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight .\n",
      "\n",
      "7472: She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment .-- Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for !-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr . Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "7474: No objection was raised on the father ' s side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend .\n",
      "\n",
      "7480: Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr . Elton as he stood before them , could impair .-- Perhaps , indeed , at that time she scarcely saw Mr . Elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself .-- Robert Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married .\n",
      "\n",
      "7488: She could not bear to see him suffering , to know him fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr . Knightleys , that when once the event were over , his distress would be soon over too , she hesitated -- she could not proceed .\n",
      "\n",
      "7493: The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and Mr . Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr . and Mrs . Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr . Knightley and Miss Woodhouse .\n",
      "\n",
      "7494: The wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and Mrs . Elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own .--\" Very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business !-- Selina would stare when she heard of it .\"\n",

      "7576: But if we do not venture somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs . Long and her daughters must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7592: The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though , when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .\n",
      "\n",
      "7600: said she , when the door was shut .\n",
      "\n",
      "7621: She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be .\n",
      "\n",
      "7656: She told the story , however , with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in anything ridiculous .\n",
      "\n",
      "7659: Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .\n",
      "\n",
      "7668: my dear Mr . Bennet ,\" as she entered the room , \" we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .\n",
      "\n",
      "7671: Everybody said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice !\n",
      "\n",
      "7673: and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .\n",
      "\n",
      "7676: But , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance .\n",

      "7677: So he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .\n",
      "\n",
      "7686: I dare say the lace upon Mrs . Hurst ' s gown ---\" Here she was interrupted again .\n",
      "\n",
      "7689: \" But I can assure you ,\" she added , \" that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .\n",
      "\n",
      "7695: Chapter 4 When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him .\n",
      "\n",
      "7696: \" He is just what a young man ought to be ,\" said she , \" sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners !-- so much ease , with such perfect good breeding !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7726: Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .\n",
      "\n",
      "7746: Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .\n",
      "\n",
      "7779: \" Aye --- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7800: The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .\n",
      "\n",
      "7805: It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united , with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .\n",
      "\n",
      "7808: If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .\n",
      "\n",
      "7811: In nine cases out of ten a women had better show more affection than she feels .\n",
      "\n",
      "7812: Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7813: \" But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .\n",
      "\n",
      "7819: Jane should therefore make the most of every half - hour in which she can command his attention .\n",
      "\n",
      "7820: When she is secure of him , there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7822: But these are not Jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design .\n",
      "\n",
      "7823: As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness .\n",
      "\n",
      "7825: She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined with him in company four times .\n",
      "\n",
      "7828: Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together --- and four evenings may do a great deal .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7830: \" Well ,\" said Charlotte , \" I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .\n",
      "\n",
      "7836: Occupied in observing Mr . Bingley ' s attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .\n",
      "\n",
      "7838: But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .\n",
      "\n",
      "7841: Of this she was perfectly unaware ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .\n",
      "\n",
      "7845: \" What does Mr . Darcy mean ,\" said she to Charlotte , \" by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7849: On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him ; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said : \" Did you not think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7856: On Miss Lucas ' s persevering , however , she added , \" Very well , if it must be so , it must .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7859: After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .\n",
      "\n",
      "7860: Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .\n",
      "\n",
      "7883: And , taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William : \" Indeed , sir , I have not the least intention of dancing .\n",
      "\n",
      "7905: How long has she been such a favourite ?-- and pray , when am I to wish you joy ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7910: You will be having a charming mother - in - law , indeed ; and , of course , she will always be at Pemberley with you .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7911: He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner ; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .\n",
      "\n",
      "7935: \" Mamma ,\" cried Lydia , \" my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke ' s library .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7937: Mrs . Bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , \" Well , Jane , who is it from ?\n",
      "\n",
      "7966: Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .\n",
      "\n",
      "7970: \" Well , my dear ,\" said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , \" if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness --- if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr . Bingley , and under your orders .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7975: As long as she stays there , it is all very well .\n",
      "\n",
      "7977: Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horsewoman , walking was her only alternative .\n",
      "\n",
      "7992: That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .\n",
      "\n",
      "7999: Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .\n",
      "\n",
      "8000: She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .\n",
      "\n",
      "8002: When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane .\n",
      "\n",
      "8003: The apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .\n",
      "\n",
      "8006: When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go , and very unwillingly said so .\n",
      "\n",
      "8007: Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present .\n",
      "\n",
      "8010: To the civil inquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr . Bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer .\n",
      "\n",
      "8013: Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .\n",
      "\n",
      "8014: His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .\n",
      "\n",
      "8017: When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "8018: Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no beauty .\n",
      "\n",
      "8025: Why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?\n",
      "\n",
      "8029: I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "8034: What could she mean by it ?\n",
      "\n",
      "8039: A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs . Hurst began again : \" I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled .\n",
      "\n",
      "8048: She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep , and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "8049: On entering the drawing - room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below , with a book .\n",
      "\n",
      "8060: Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "8076: Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card - table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .\n",
      "\n",
      "8078: said Miss Bingley ; \" will she be as tall as I am ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8079: \" I think she will .\n",
      "\n",
      "8091: I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8101: A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half - deserved .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8102: \" All this she must possess ,\" added Darcy , \" and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8115: Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .\n",
      "\n",
      "8117: This she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better .\n",
      "\n",
      "8120: Chapter 9 Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .\n",
      "\n",
      "8121: In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgement of her situation .\n",
      "\n",
      "8124: Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs . Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield .\n",
      "\n",
      "8127: Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs . Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .\n",
      "\n",
      "8136: \" You may depend upon it , Madam ,\" said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , \" that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8138: \" I am sure ,\" she added , \" if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I have ever met with .\n",
      "\n",
      "8164: Mrs . Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .\n",
      "\n",
      "8180: \" Yes , she called yesterday with her father .\n",
      "\n",
      "8187: \" No , she would go home .\n",
      "\n",
      "8188: I fancy she was wanted about the mince - pies .\n",
      "\n",
      "8192: Not that I think Charlotte so very plain --- but then she is our particular friend .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8195: dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain .\n",
      "\n",
      "8200: When she was only fifteen , there was a man at my brother Gardiner ' s in town so much in love with her that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .\n",
      "\n",
      "8221: But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill .\" Lydia declared herself satisfied .\n",
      "\n",
      "8224: And when you have given your ball ,\" she added , \" I shall insist on their giving one also .\n",
      "\n",
      "8299: Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended , and therefore checked her laugh .\n",
      "\n",
      "8309: Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte ; and , after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "8310: Mrs . Hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed , Elizabeth could not help observing , as she turned over some music - books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her .\n",
      "\n",
      "8311: She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .\n",
      "\n",
      "8312: She could only imagine , however , at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .\n",
      "\n",
      "8319: said she , \" I heard you before , but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply .\n",
      "\n",
      "8327: \" I hope ,\" said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , \" you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do sure the younger girls of running after officers .\n",
      "\n",
      "8340: Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "8348: She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .\n",
      "\n",
      "8350: Chapter 11 When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room , where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .\n",
      "\n",
      "8353: But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object ; Miss Bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .\n",
      "\n",
      "8356: The first half - hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace , that she might be further from the door .\n",
      "\n",
      "8364: Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .\n",
      "\n",
      "8366: At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , \" How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !\n",
      "\n",
      "8371: She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said : \" By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ?\n",
      "\n",
      "8374: \" I should like balls infinitely better ,\" she replied , \" if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .\n",
      "\n",
      "8377: Miss Bingley made no answer , and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "8378: Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .\n",
      "\n",
      "8379: In the desperation of her feelings , she resolved on one effort more , and , turning to Elizabeth , said : \" Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "8387: --- and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?\n",
      "\n",
      "8390: \" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them ,\" said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .\n",
      "\n",
      "8443: \" Do let us have a little music ,\" cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .\n",
      "\n",
      "8450: Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to Elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home .\n",
      "\n",
      "8451: Mrs . Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .\n",
      "\n",
      "8452: Against staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved --- nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .\n",
      "\n",
      "8454: Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .\n",
      "\n",
      "8455: The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her --- that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .\n",
      "\n",
      "8461: Miss Bingley ' s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former .\n",
      "\n",
      "8473: I do not believe she often sees such at home .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8492: They had often attempted to do it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . Bennet was beyond the reach of reason , and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .\n",
      "\n",
      "8510: \" He must be an oddity , I think ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "8520: As for their mother , Mr . Collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill - will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters .\n",
      "\n",
      "8543: In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .\n",
      "\n",
      "8552: She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .\n",
      "\n",
      "8553: She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage , where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself --- some shelves in the closet upstairs .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8554: \" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure ,\" said Mrs . Bennet , \" and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman .\n",
      "\n",
      "8556: Does she live near you , sir ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8558: \" I think you said she was a widow , sir ?\n",
      "\n",
      "8559: Has she any family ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8562: said Mrs . Bennet , shaking her head , \" then she is better off than many girls .\n",
      "\n",
      "8563: And what sort of young lady is she ?\n",
      "\n",
      "8564: Is she handsome ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8567: She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of , as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .\n",
      "\n",
      "8568: But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8569: \" Has she been presented ?\n",
      "\n",
      "8584: Lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with : \" Do you know , mamma , that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard ; and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him .\n",
      "\n",
      "8599: Miss Bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice .\n",
      "\n",
      "8601: \" As to her younger daughters , she could not take upon her to say --- she could not positively answer --- but she did not know of any prepossession ; her eldest daughter , she must just mention --- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8604: Mrs . Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces .\n",
      "\n",
      "8628: Mrs . Phillips was always glad to see her nieces ; and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones ' s shop - boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane ' s introduction of him .\n",
      "\n",
      "8630: Mrs . Phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other ; of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant ' s commission in the ---- shire .\n",
      "\n",
      "8631: She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr . Wickham appeared , Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become \" stupid , disagreeable fellows .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8636: As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be in the wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "8638: He protested that , except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .\n",
      "\n",
      "8641: When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs . Phillips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor --- when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ' s drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room .\n",
      "\n",
      "8642: In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs . Phillips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .\n",
      "\n",
      "8645: The gentlemen did approach , and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .\n",
      "\n",
      "8652: At first there seemed danger of Lydia ' s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular .\n",
      "\n",
      "8653: Allowing for the common demands of the game , Mr . Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told --- the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy .\n",
      "\n",
      "8720: \" But what ,\" said she , after a pause , \" can have been his motive ?\n",
      "\n",
      "8728: After a few minutes ' reflection , however , she continued , \" I do remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .\n",
      "\n",
      "8732: She could have added , \" A young man , too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable \"--- but she contented herself with , \" and one , too , who had probably been his companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8755: But she is too much like her brother --- very , very proud .\n",
      "\n",
      "8756: As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .\n",
      "\n",
      "8757: But she is nothing to me now .\n",
      "\n",
      "8775: It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs . Phillips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged that she would not make herself uneasy .\n",
      "\n",
      "8779: \" Lady Catherine de Bourgh ,\" she replied , \" has very lately given him a living .\n",
      "\n",
      "8781: \" You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "8786: \" Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8787: This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley .\n",
      "\n",
      "8789: \" Mr . Collins ,\" said she , \" speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8791: She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride for her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8797: Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won ; and Mr . Collins in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs . Phillips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .\n",
      "\n",
      "8799: Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . Bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham .\n",
      "\n",
      "8801: \" They have both ,\" said she , \" been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .\n",
      "\n",
      "8821: The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .\n",
      "\n",
      "8828: And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .\n",
      "\n",
      "8829: \" While I can have my mornings to myself ,\" said she , \" it is enough --- I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .\n",
      "\n",
      "8831: Elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on this occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .\n",
      "\n",
      "8837: Mr . Wickham ' s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .\n",
      "\n",
      "8839: It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .\n",
      "\n",
      "8840: The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her .\n",
      "\n",
      "8850: This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and , as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .\n",
      "\n",
      "8852: She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill - humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .\n",
      "\n",
      "8853: But Elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .\n",
      "\n",
      "8858: When those dances were over , she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .\n",
      "\n",
      "8859: He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her : \" I dare say you will find him very agreeable .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8865: Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks , their equal amazement in beholding it .\n",
      "\n",
      "8866: They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .\n",
      "\n",
      "8868: After a pause of some minutes , she addressed him a second time with :--\" It is your turn to say something now , Mr . Darcy .\n",
      "\n",
      "8870: He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .\n",
      "\n",
      "8886: He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .\n",
      "\n",
      "8916: \" Yes , always ,\" she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , \" I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .\n",
      "\n",
      "8923: \" Merely to the illustration of your character ,\" said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .\n",
      "\n",
      "8948: Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .\n",
      "\n",
      "8950: \" I want to know ,\" said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , \" what you have learnt about Mr . Wickham .\n",
      "\n",
      "8965: On their being joined by Mr . Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr . Collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .\n",
      "\n",
      "8979: Mr . Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and , when she ceased speaking , replied thus : \" My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding ; but permit me to say , that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for , give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom --- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .\n",
      "\n",
      "8982: And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr . Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .\n",
      "\n",
      "8983: Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words \" apology ,\" \" Hunsford ,\" and \" Lady Catherine de Bourgh .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8990: He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .\n",
      "\n",
      "8993: As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley ; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .\n",
      "\n",
      "8994: She saw her in idea settled in that very house , in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable , under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ' s two sisters .\n",
      "\n",
      "8995: Her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .\n",
      "\n",
      "8996: When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr . Bingley .\n",
      "\n",
      "8998: His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .\n",
      "\n",
      "8999: It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .\n",
      "\n",
      "9002: In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for , to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them .\n",
      "\n",
      "9009: Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .\n",
      "\n",
      "9012: She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .\n",
      "\n",
      "9014: At length , however , Mrs . Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .\n",
      "\n",
      "9016: But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for , when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .\n",
      "\n",
      "9017: By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .\n",
      "\n",
      "9018: Elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations , and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving , amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .\n",
      "\n",
      "9021: She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .\n",
      "\n",
      "9038: To Elizabeth it appeared that , had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .\n",
      "\n",
      "9039: That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations , was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .\n",
      "\n",
      "9042: In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "9058: Mrs . Bennet was perfectly satisfied , and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages , and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months .\n",
      "\n",
      "9059: Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .\n",
      "\n",
      "9066: I am sure Lizzy will be very happy --- I am sure she can have no objection .\n",
      "\n",
      "9068: And , gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out : \" Dear madam , do not go .\n",
      "\n",
      "9075: And upon Elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added : \" Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "9077: Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction --- and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again and tried to conceal , by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .\n",
      "\n",
      "9084: The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing , that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further , and he continued : \" My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly --- which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .\n",
      "\n",
      "9085: Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too !)\n",
      "\n",
      "9086: on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford --- between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs . Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh ' s footstool , that she said , ' Mr .\n",
      "\n",
      "9101: \" You are too hasty , sir ,\" she cried .\n",
      "\n",
      "9112: Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9120: And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had Mr . Collins not thus addressed her : \" When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9137: Chapter 20 Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs . Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection .\n",
      "\n",
      "9139: This information , however , startled Mrs . Bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not believe it , and could not help saying so .\n",
      "\n",
      "9140: \" But , depend upon it , Mr . Collins ,\" she added , \" that Lizzy shall be brought to reason .\n",
      "\n",
      "9143: \" Pardon me for interrupting you , madam ,\" cried Mr . Collins ; \" but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .\n",
      "\n",
      "9144: If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9147: In everything else she is as good - natured a girl as ever lived .\n",
      "\n",
      "9149: She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , \" Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "9151: You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9152: Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .\n",
      "\n",
      "9153: \" I have not the pleasure of understanding you ,\" said he , when she had finished her speech .\n",
      "\n",
      "9156: Lizzy declares she will not have Mr . Collins , and Mr . Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9164: \" Come here , child ,\" cried her father as she appeared .\n",
      "\n",
      "9180: Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning , but Mrs . Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .\n",
      "\n",
      "9196: Mr . Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9197: Charlotte hardly had time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news ; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room , where Mrs . Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .\n",
      "\n",
      "9198: \" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas ,\" she added in a melancholy tone , \" for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me .\n",
      "\n",
      "9201: \" Aye , there she comes ,\" continued Mrs . Bennet , \" looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way .\n",
      "\n",
      "9213: She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them , till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered the room with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , \" Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let me and Mr . Collins have a little conversation together .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9214: Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .\n",
      "\n",
      "9239: His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .\n",
      "\n",
      "9241: The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot - pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , flowing hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .\n",
      "\n",
      "9245: You shall hear what she says .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9249: To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .\n",
      "\n",
      "9250: \" It is unlucky ,\" said she , after a short pause , \" that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .\n",
      "\n",
      "9251: But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?\n",
      "\n",
      "9266: I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "9271: said Jane as she finished it .\n",
      "\n",
      "9273: Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly !)\n",
      "\n",
      "9287: Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .\n",
      "\n",
      "9288: But the case is this : We are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .\n",
      "\n",
      "9292: Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9306: It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone .\n",
      "\n",
      "9307: She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .\n",
      "\n",
      "9308: Jane ' s temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .\n",
      "\n",
      "9309: They agreed that Mrs . Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together .\n",
      "\n",
      "9310: After lamenting it , however , at some length , she had the consolation that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration , that though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .\n",
      "\n",
      "9313: \" It keeps him in good humour ,\" said she , \" and I am more obliged to you than I can express .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9316: Such was Miss Lucas ' s scheme ; and appearances were so favourable , that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon .\n",
      "\n",
      "9317: But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet .\n",
      "\n",
      "9321: But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .\n",
      "\n",
      "9335: This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "9336: The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .\n",
      "\n",
      "9351: She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers , he might become a very agreeable companion .\n",
      "\n",
      "9354: The possibility of Mr . Collins ' s fancying herself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out : \" Engaged to Mr . Collins !\n",
      "\n",
      "9356: The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied : \" Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ?\n",
      "\n",
      "9358: But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .\n",
      "\n",
      "9365: Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .\n",
      "\n",
      "9366: It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .\n",
      "\n",
      "9368: She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she had not supposed it to be possible that , when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .\n",
      "\n",
      "9370: And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .\n",
      "\n",
      "9371: Chapter 23 Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter , to announce her engagement to the family .\n",
      "\n",
      "9376: Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .\n",
      "\n",
      "9378: In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .\n",
      "\n",
      "9379: Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole : one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief ; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .\n",
      "\n",
      "9382: A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .\n",
      "\n",
      "9384: Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .\n",
      "\n",
      "9386: Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs . Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs . Bennet ' s sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .\n",
      "\n",
      "9388: Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return .\n",
      "\n",
      "9389: Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .\n",
      "\n",
      "9391: After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .\n",
      "\n",
      "9393: On the contrary , she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .\n",
      "\n",
      "9398: Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .\n",
      "\n",
      "9400: Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane ' s happiness , and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently occurring .\n",
      "\n",
      "9401: The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .\n",
      "\n",
      "9402: As for Jane , her anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ' s , but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .\n",
      "\n",
      "9403: But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used .\n",
      "\n",
      "9409: The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill - humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .\n",
      "\n",
      "9411: As her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .\n",
      "\n",
      "9412: Whenever Charlotte came to see them , she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead .\n",
      "\n",
      "9414: \" Indeed , Mr . Bennet ,\" said she , \" it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take her place in it !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9418: This was not very consoling to Mrs . Bennet , and therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before .\n",
      "\n",
      "9430: Hope was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .\n",
      "\n",
      "9436: To Caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit .\n",
      "\n",
      "9437: That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution , which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination .\n",
      "\n",
      "9438: Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best , but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "9441: A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last , on Mrs . Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying : \" Oh , that my dear mother had more command over herself !\n",
      "\n",
      "9442: She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .\n",
      "\n",
      "9453: With a stronger voice she soon added , \" I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9473: Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for everybody ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9513: Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .\n",
      "\n",
      "9543: When this was done she had a less active part to play .\n",
      "\n",
      "9546: They had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "9548: \" I do not blame Jane ,\" she continued , \" for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley if she could .\n",
      "\n",
      "9551: It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins ' s wife by this time , had it not been for her own perverseness .\n",
      "\n",
      "9552: He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .\n",
      "\n",
      "9560: When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .\n",
      "\n",
      "9561: \" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "9578: I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .\n",
      "\n",
      "9580: But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us ?\n",
      "\n",
      "9593: But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ' s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .\n",
      "\n",
      "9594: It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be reanimated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane ' s attractions .\n",
      "\n",
      "9595: Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time , than as she hoped by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .\n",
      "\n",
      "9599: Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .\n",
      "\n",
      "9601: About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged .\n",
      "\n",
      "9602: They had , therefore , many acquaintances in common ; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ' s father , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring .\n",
      "\n",
      "9605: In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "9606: On being made acquainted with the present Mr . Darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember some of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it , and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr . Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy .\n",
      "\n",
      "9607: Chapter 26 Mrs . Gardiner ' s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : \" You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly .\n",
      "\n",
      "9641: Her aunt assured her that she was , and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .\n",
      "\n",
      "9643: His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say , in an ill - natured tone , that she \" _wished_ they might be happy .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9644: Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "9652: Elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .\n",
      "\n",
      "9658: Charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .\n",
      "\n",
      "9659: She wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .\n",
      "\n",
      "9661: It was Mr . Collins ' s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest .\n",
      "\n",
      "9662: Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys .\n",
      "\n",
      "9666: \" My aunt ,\" she continued , \" is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9667: She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .\n",
      "\n",
      "9668: \" I did not think Caroline in spirits ,\" were her words , \" but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London .\n",
      "\n",
      "9679: She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ' s inattention .\n",
      "\n",
      "9681: The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt .\n",
      "\n",
      "9686: When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .\n",
      "\n",
      "9688: She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side .\n",
      "\n",
      "9689: But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "9690: I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable .\n",
      "\n",
      "9692: He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .\n",
      "\n",
      "9702: This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .\n",
      "\n",
      "9705: His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy ' s sister , as by Wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .\n",
      "\n",
      "9708: Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .\n",
      "\n",
      "9709: Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .\n",
      "\n",
      "9711: Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .\n",
      "\n",
      "9712: All this was acknowledged to Mrs . Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : \" I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .\n",
      "\n",
      "9722: She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .\n",
      "\n",
      "9725: The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .\n",
      "\n",
      "9731: His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her --- their opinion of everybody --- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .\n",
      "\n",
      "9734: Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ' s too long .\n",
      "\n",
      "9737: As they drove to Mr . Gardiner ' s door , Jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .\n",
      "\n",
      "9742: Their first object was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute inquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .\n",
      "\n",
      "9746: \" But my dear Elizabeth ,\" she added , \" what sort of girl is Miss King ?\n",
      "\n",
      "9759: If she does not object to it , why should we ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9763: He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9773: Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .\n",
      "\n",
      "9776: \" Oh , my dear , dear aunt ,\" she rapturously cried , \" what delight !\n",
      "\n",
      "9787: Chapter 28 Every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .\n",
      "\n",
      "9790: Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .\n",
      "\n",
      "9795: Mrs . Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received .\n",
      "\n",
      "9798: Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .\n",
      "\n",
      "9799: But though everything seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance , and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion .\n",
      "\n",
      "9800: When Mr . Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .\n",
      "\n",
      "9801: Once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear .\n",
      "\n",
      "9803: To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .\n",
      "\n",
      "9814: I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .\n",
      "\n",
      "9818: I should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9825: About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and , after listening a moment , she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .\n",
      "\n",
      "9839: Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9841: Why does she not come in ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9842: \" Oh , Charlotte says she hardly ever does .\n",
      "\n",
      "9846: Yes , she will do for him very well .\n",
      "\n",
      "9867: Such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St . James ' s .\n",
      "\n",
      "9869: Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh .\n",
      "\n",
      "9872: She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation .\n",
      "\n",
      "9879: She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self - importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented .\n",
      "\n",
      "9880: When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ' s astonishment at her being so thin and so small .\n",
      "\n",
      "9882: Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .\n",
      "\n",
      "9888: Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh --- the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner - time .\n",
      "\n",
      "9889: Mrs . Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she was indisposed .\n",
      "\n",
      "9891: When the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner , as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted .\n",
      "\n",
      "9894: In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs . Collins was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .\n",
      "\n",
      "9895: She asked her , at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s maiden name ?\n",
      "\n",
      "9925: Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case .\n",
      "\n",
      "9939: ' Lady Catherine ,' said she , ' you have given me a treasure .'\n",
      "\n",
      "9949: Perhaps she is full young to be much in company .\n",
      "\n",
      "9972: As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was .\n",
      "\n",
      "9977: Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining - parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a more pleasant aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement .\n",
      "\n",
      "9980: Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .\n",
      "\n",
      "9982: She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture ; or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs . Collins ' s joints of meat were too large for her family .\n",
      "\n",
      "9983: Elizabeth soon perceived , that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented , or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .\n",
      "\n",
      "9986: This , however , was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half - hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .\n",
      "\n",
      "9987: Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine ' s curiosity .\n",
      "\n",
      "9990: Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine , who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "10004: She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane , and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet .\n",
      "\n",
      "10011: Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "10014: His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship , after a while , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out : \" What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ?\n",
      "\n",
      "10026: I am confident that she would have performed delightfully .\n",
      "\n",
      "10029: \" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her ,\" said Lady Catherine ; \" and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10030: \" I assure you , madam ,\" he replied , \" that she does not need such advice .\n",
      "\n",
      "10035: I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well unless she practises more ; and though Mrs . Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs . Jenkinson ' s room .\n",
      "\n",
      "10038: When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument .\n",
      "\n",
      "10078: Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy : \" Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .\n",
      "\n",
      "10081: Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .\n",
      "\n",
      "10084: Chapter 32 Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane while Mrs . Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .\n",
      "\n",
      "10085: As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half - finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and , to her very great surprise , Mr . Darcy , and Mr . Darcy only , entered the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "10088: It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed : \" How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr . Darcy !\n",
      "\n",
      "10092: She found that she was to receive no other answer , and , after a short pause added : \" I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10102: \" I believe she did --- and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10105: My friend has an excellent understanding --- though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest thing she ever did .\n",
      "\n",
      "10117: As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered : \" I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .\n",
      "\n",
      "10136: It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .\n",
      "\n",
      "10141: Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love , and the object of that love her friend Eliza , she set herself seriously to work to find it out .\n",
      "\n",
      "10144: It was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .\n",
      "\n",
      "10145: She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs . Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .\n",
      "\n",
      "10146: In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .\n",
      "\n",
      "10153: He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions --- about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs . Collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too .\n",
      "\n",
      "10157: It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage .\n",
      "\n",
      "10158: She was engaged one day as she walked , in perusing Jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .\n",
      "\n",
      "10159: Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said : \" I did not know before that you ever walked this way .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10163: And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together .\n",
      "\n",
      "10165: said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "10186: and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , \" And pray , what is the usual price of an earl ' s younger son ?\n",
      "\n",
      "10189: To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said : \" I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal .\n",
      "\n",
      "10191: But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10197: Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10198: As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly ; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .\n",
      "\n",
      "10200: I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "10223: After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .\n",
      "\n",
      "10224: \" I am thinking of what you have been telling me ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "10229: But ,\" she continued , recollecting herself , \" as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .\n",
      "\n",
      "10232: This was spoken jestingly ; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer , and therefore , abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage .\n",
      "\n",
      "10233: There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .\n",
      "\n",
      "10234: It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .\n",
      "\n",
      "10236: That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .\n",
      "\n",
      "10240: \" To Jane herself ,\" she exclaimed , \" there could be no possibility of objection ; all loveliness and goodness as she is !-- her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .\n",
      "\n",
      "10242: When she thought of her mother , her confidence gave way a little ; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr . Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "10244: Mrs . Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her ; but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home .\n",
      "\n",
      "10250: It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next --- and , a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .\n",
      "\n",
      "10251: She could not think of Darcy ' s leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .\n",
      "\n",
      "10252: While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door - bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to inquire particularly after her .\n",
      "\n",
      "10253: But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "10254: In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .\n",
      "\n",
      "10267: In spite of her deeply - rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .\n",
      "\n",
      "10270: As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .\n",
      "\n",
      "10272: Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and , when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said : \" In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .\n",
      "\n",
      "10285: \" I might as well inquire ,\" replied she , \" why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?\n",
      "\n",
      "10290: As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued : \" I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .\n",
      "\n",
      "10296: she repeated .\n",
      "\n",
      "10300: \" But it is not merely this affair ,\" she continued , \" on which my dislike is founded .\n",
      "\n",
      "10326: Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said : \" You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10327: She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued : \" You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10336: Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "10337: That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy !\n",
      "\n",
      "10342: She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room .\n",
      "\n",
      "10344: She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of anything else ; and , totally indisposed for employment , she resolved , soon after breakfast , to indulge herself in air and exercise .\n",
      "\n",
      "10345: She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led farther from the turnpike - road .\n",
      "\n",
      "10346: The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .\n",
      "\n",
      "10347: After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .\n",
      "\n",
      "10348: The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .\n",
      "\n",
      "10349: She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and , fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly retreating .\n",
      "\n",
      "10351: She had turned away ; but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Mr . Darcy , she moved again towards the gate .\n",
      "\n",
      "10352: He had by that time reached it also , and , holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said , with a look of haughty composure , \" I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .\n",
      "\n",
      "10357: Pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .\n",
      "\n",
      "10374: Her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .\n",
      "\n",
      "10435: About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .\n",
      "\n",
      "10437: I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .\n",
      "\n",
      "10449: Chapter 36 If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .\n",
      "\n",
      "10450: But such as they were , it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .\n",
      "\n",
      "10451: Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .\n",
      "\n",
      "10452: With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded , that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .\n",
      "\n",
      "10453: With a strong prejudice against everything he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield .\n",
      "\n",
      "10455: His belief of her sister ' s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false ; and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .\n",
      "\n",
      "10458: But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham --- when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself --- her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .\n",
      "\n",
      "10463: --- and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .\n",
      "\n",
      "10464: In this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .\n",
      "\n",
      "10465: The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .\n",
      "\n",
      "10466: So far each recital confirmed the other ; but when she came to the will , the difference was great .\n",
      "\n",
      "10467: What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .\n",
      "\n",
      "10468: But when she read and re - read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham ' s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .\n",
      "\n",
      "10469: She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality --- deliberated on the probability of each statement --- but with little success .\n",
      "\n",
      "10471: Again she read on ; but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr . Darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .\n",
      "\n",
      "10472: The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr . Wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .\n",
      "\n",
      "10475: As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of inquiring .\n",
      "\n",
      "10477: She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years ' continuance .\n",
      "\n",
      "10479: She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .\n",
      "\n",
      "10480: After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .\n",
      "\n",
      "10482: the story which followed , of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself --- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .\n",
      "\n",
      "10483: At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s corroboration .\n",
      "\n",
      "10492: His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown .\n",
      "\n",
      "10493: Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance --- an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways --- seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust --- anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits ; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued --- that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling ; that had his actions been what Mr . Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible .\n",
      "\n",
      "10495: Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .\n",
      "\n",
      "10497: she cried ; \" I , who have prided myself on my discernment !\n",
      "\n",
      "10506: From herself to Jane --- from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy ' s explanation there had appeared very insufficient , and she read it again .\n",
      "\n",
      "10508: How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?\n",
      "\n",
      "10509: He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister ' s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ' s opinion had always been .\n",
      "\n",
      "10510: Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane .\n",
      "\n",
      "10512: When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .\n",
      "\n",
      "10515: It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self - attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that Jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before .\n",
      "\n",
      "10516: After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought --- re - considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself , as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .\n",
      "\n",
      "10517: She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leave --- but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .\n",
      "\n",
      "10518: Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it .\n",
      "\n",
      "10519: Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object ; she could think only of her letter .\n",
      "\n",
      "10521: To Rosings he then hastened , to console Lady Catherine and her daughter ; and on his return brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .\n",
      "\n",
      "10522: Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that , had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been .\n",
      "\n",
      "10523: \" What would she have said ?\n",
      "\n",
      "10524: how would she have behaved ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10525: were questions with which she amused herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "10534: Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it by herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added : \" But if that is the case , you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer .\n",
      "\n",
      "10571: Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .\n",
      "\n",
      "10572: Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .\n",
      "\n",
      "10573: Mr . Darcy ' s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .\n",
      "\n",
      "10575: When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .\n",
      "\n",
      "10576: His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .\n",
      "\n",
      "10597: She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .\n",
      "\n",
      "10612: Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add , that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .\n",
      "\n",
      "10616: But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .\n",
      "\n",
      "10633: It was not without an effort , meanwhile , that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy ' s proposals .\n",
      "\n",
      "10634: To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further .\n",
      "\n",
      "10643: And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , \" Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "10672: \" She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10695: and so she asked the two Harringtons to come , but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ?\n",
      "\n",
      "10705: Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham ' s name .\n",
      "\n",
      "10710: Mary ,\" said she , \" I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !\n",
      "\n",
      "10727: In a fortnight they were to go --- and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .\n",
      "\n",
      "10728: She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .\n",
      "\n",
      "10730: Chapter 40 Elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length , resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . Darcy and herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "10732: She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him .\n",
      "\n",
      "10733: \" His being so sure of succeeding was wrong ,\" said she , \" and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10745: Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear the one without involving the other .\n",
      "\n",
      "10751: \" I do not know when I have been more shocked ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "10800: She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .\n",
      "\n",
      "10802: She dared not relate the other half of Mr . Darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend .\n",
      "\n",
      "10803: Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery .\n",
      "\n",
      "10804: \" And then ,\" said she , \" if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "10809: Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and , from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .\n",
      "\n",
      "10822: But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .\n",
      "\n",
      "10827: If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .\n",
      "\n",
      "10852: Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five - and - twenty years ago .\n",
      "\n",
      "10853: \" I am sure ,\" said she , \" I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller ' s regiment went away .\n",
      "\n",
      "10864: She felt anew the justice of Mr . Darcy ' s objections ; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .\n",
      "\n",
      "10865: But the gloom of Lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . Forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton .\n",
      "\n",
      "10870: \" I cannot see why Mrs . Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia ,\" said she , \" Though I am not her particular friend .\n",
      "\n",
      "10871: I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10873: As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .\n",
      "\n",
      "10874: She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs . Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .\n",
      "\n",
      "10875: He heard her attentively , and then said : \" Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10879: \" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?\n",
      "\n",
      "10889: If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .\n",
      "\n",
      "10890: Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous ; a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .\n",
      "\n",
      "10900: Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody .\n",
      "\n",
      "10901: At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .\n",
      "\n",
      "10904: At any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10905: With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .\n",
      "\n",
      "10912: She saw all the glories of the camp --- its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and , to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .\n",
      "\n",
      "10913: Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?\n",
      "\n",
      "10920: In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .\n",
      "\n",
      "10921: She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified , and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .\n",
      "\n",
      "10922: On the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining at Meryton , he dined , with other of the officers , at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s and Mr . Darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him , if he was acquainted with the former .\n",
      "\n",
      "10923: He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and , after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man , asked her how she had liked him .\n",
      "\n",
      "10939: While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .\n",
      "\n",
      "10940: There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added : \" When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement , but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10945: Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .\n",
      "\n",
      "10946: She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .\n",
      "\n",
      "10950: Kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy .\n",
      "\n",
      "10951: Mrs . Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible --- advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .\n",
      "\n",
      "10952: Chapter 42 Had Elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .\n",
      "\n",
      "10960: She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .\n",
      "\n",
      "10961: But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill - judged a direction of talents ; talents , which , rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .\n",
      "\n",
      "10962: When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham ' s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .\n",
      "\n",
      "10963: Their parties abroad were less varied than before , and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering - place and a camp .\n",
      "\n",
      "10964: Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes been found before , that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not , in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "10966: Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .\n",
      "\n",
      "10967: \" But it is fortunate ,\" thought she , \" that I have something to wish for .\n",
      "\n",
      "10971: When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .\n",
      "\n",
      "10972: Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . Forster called her , and they were going off to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt --- for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .\n",
      "\n",
      "10976: Mrs . Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity ; and , by the middle of June , Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless , by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton .\n",
      "\n",
      "10980: The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , Chatsworth , Dovedale , or the Peak .\n",
      "\n",
      "10981: Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes , and still thought there might have been time enough .\n",
      "\n",
      "10985: \" But surely ,\" said she , \" I may enter his county without impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "10995: To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs . Gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated .\n",
      "\n",
      "11003: She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .\n",
      "\n",
      "11004: She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .\n",
      "\n",
      "11006: \" If it were merely a fine house richly furnished ,\" said she , \" I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful .\n",
      "\n",
      "11012: But against this there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered .\n",
      "\n",
      "11013: Accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place ?\n",
      "\n",
      "11016: A most welcome negative followed the last question --- and her alarms now being removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .\n",
      "\n",
      "11021: Elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .\n",
      "\n",
      "11027: They were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something !\n",
      "\n",
      "11030: On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .\n",
      "\n",
      "11031: The housekeeper came ; a respectable - looking elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .\n",
      "\n",
      "11036: Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .\n",
      "\n",
      "11039: \" And of this place ,\" thought she , \" I might have been mistress !\n",
      "\n",
      "11045: At length however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . Reynolds replied that he was , adding , \" But we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11049: Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .\n",
      "\n",
      "11051: \" He is now gone into the army ,\" she added ; \" but I am afraid he has turned out very wild .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11067: Mrs . Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .\n",
      "\n",
      "11072: In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her --- a present from my master ; she comes here to - morrow with him .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11076: \" Except ,\" thought Elizabeth , \" when she goes to Ramsgate .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11083: Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , \" I have never known a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11086: Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying : \" There are very few people of whom so much can be said .\n",
      "\n",
      "11094: thought she .\n",
      "\n",
      "11099: She related the subjects of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain , Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase .\n",
      "\n",
      "11100: \" He is the best landlord , and the best master ,\" said she , \" that ever lived ; not like the wild young men nowadays , who think of nothing but themselves .\n",
      "\n",
      "11110: \" He is certainly a good brother ,\" said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .\n",
      "\n",
      "11111: Mrs . Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "11112: \" And this is always the way with him ,\" she added .\n",
      "\n",
      "11116: In the former were many good paintings ; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy ' s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .\n",
      "\n",
      "11119: At last it arrested her --- and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr . Darcy , with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her .\n",
      "\n",
      "11122: There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance .\n",
      "\n",
      "11125: As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship !-- how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow !-- how much of good or evil must be done by him !\n",
      "\n",
      "11126: Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .\n",
      "\n",
      "11134: They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family .\n",
      "\n",
      "11143: It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !\n",
      "\n",
      "11145: why did she come ?\n",
      "\n",
      "11151: Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .\n",
      "\n",
      "11154: They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .\n",
      "\n",
      "11156: She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind --- in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of everything , she was still dear to him .\n",
      "\n",
      "11158: Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .\n",
      "\n",
      "11159: At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "11170: For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .\n",
      "\n",
      "11172: With a glance , she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words \" delightful ,\" and \" charming ,\" when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed .\n",
      "\n",
      "11173: Her colour changed , and she said no more .\n",
      "\n",
      "11174: Mrs . Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .\n",
      "\n",
      "11175: This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "11176: \" What will be his surprise ,\" thought she , \" when he knows who they are ?\n",
      "\n",
      "11178: The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it , and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .\n",
      "\n",
      "11181: It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .\n",
      "\n",
      "11183: The conversation soon turned upon fishing ; and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .\n",
      "\n",
      "11186: Her astonishment , however , was extreme , and continually was she repeating , \" Why is he so altered ?\n",
      "\n",
      "11195: She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected ---\" for your housekeeper ,\" she added , \" informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11199: Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr . Bingley ' s name had been the last mentioned between them ; and , if she might judge by his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .\n",
      "\n",
      "11202: The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .\n",
      "\n",
      "11205: Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .\n",
      "\n",
      "11208: He then asked her to walk into the house --- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .\n",
      "\n",
      "11211: At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance .\n",
      "\n",
      "11224: Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "11235: Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .\n",
      "\n",
      "11236: In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as such as might be relied on .\n",
      "\n",
      "11237: Mrs . Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else .\n",
      "\n",
      "11238: Fatigued as she had been by the morning ' s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years ' discontinuance .\n",
      "\n",
      "11239: The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr . Darcy ' s civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "11243: Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .\n",
      "\n",
      "11244: Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .\n",
      "\n",
      "11247: She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and , more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .\n",
      "\n",
      "11248: She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse .\n",
      "\n",
      "11251: Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy .\n",
      "\n",
      "11256: They had not long been together before Mr . Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "11257: All Elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again .\n",
      "\n",
      "11265: She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors ; she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .\n",
      "\n",
      "11268: how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner .\n",
      "\n",
      "11269: Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that , as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .\n",
      "\n",
      "11270: But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a rival to Jane .\n",
      "\n",
      "11273: On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .\n",
      "\n",
      "11274: He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it \" was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ;\" and , before she could reply , he added , \" It is above eight months .\n",
      "\n",
      "11278: It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .\n",
      "\n",
      "11279: When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace --- when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage --- the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .\n",
      "\n",
      "11280: Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self - consequence or unbending reserve , as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings .\n",
      "\n",
      "11283: Mrs . Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head .\n",
      "\n",
      "11284: Presuming however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .\n",
      "\n",
      "11287: Eager to be alone , and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress .\n",
      "\n",
      "11288: But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication .\n",
      "\n",
      "11289: It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her .\n",
      "\n",
      "11298: As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out .\n",
      "\n",
      "11300: No ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .\n",
      "\n",
      "11304: He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "11306: She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses .\n",
      "\n",
      "11307: It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "11309: Elizabeth was pleased ; though when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .\n",
      "\n",
      "11312: Chapter 45 Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side the acquaintance would now be renewed .\n",
      "\n",
      "11315: In this house they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London .\n",
      "\n",
      "11320: Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard .\n",
      "\n",
      "11321: Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention .\n",
      "\n",
      "11322: This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .\n",
      "\n",
      "11325: She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .\n",
      "\n",
      "11330: While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .\n",
      "\n",
      "11332: No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "11333: In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over .\n",
      "\n",
      "11337: In Darcy ' s presence she dared not mention Wickham ' s name ; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone .\n",
      "\n",
      "11338: While she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her Darcy , with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .\n",
      "\n",
      "11339: Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ' s opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .\n",
      "\n",
      "11344: Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully .\n",
      "\n",
      "11349: When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "11350: \" How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy ,\" she cried ; \" I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter .\n",
      "\n",
      "11354: \" For my own part ,\" she rejoined , \" I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .\n",
      "\n",
      "11359: Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .\n",
      "\n",
      "11360: He was resolutely silent , however , and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued : \" I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' _She_ a beauty !-- I should as soon call her mother a wit .'\n",
      "\n",
      "11361: But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11374: An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham !\n",
      "\n",
      "11392: Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .\n",
      "\n",
      "11410: Could she exert herself , it would be better ; but this is not to be expected .\n",
      "\n",
      "11423: cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared .\n",
      "\n",
      "11424: Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , \" I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .\n",
      "\n",
      "11430: Elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .\n",
      "\n",
      "11431: Calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home instantly .\n",
      "\n",
      "11432: On his quitting the room she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , \" Let me call your maid .\n",
      "\n",
      "11435: You are very ill .\" \" No , I thank you ,\" she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "11438: She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .\n",
      "\n",
      "11440: At length she spoke again .\n",
      "\n",
      "11446: She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to --- she is lost for ever .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11448: \" When I consider ,\" she added in a yet more agitated voice , \" that I might have prevented it !\n",
      "\n",
      "11474: It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .\n",
      "\n",
      "11476: Lydia --- the humiliation , the misery she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner which , though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , \" I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern .\n",
      "\n",
      "11485: As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .\n",
      "\n",
      "11487: But if otherwise --- if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill success might , perhaps , authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .\n",
      "\n",
      "11488: Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .\n",
      "\n",
      "11489: Never , since reading Jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham ' s meaning to marry her .\n",
      "\n",
      "11490: No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .\n",
      "\n",
      "11492: While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind , she was all surprise --- all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible .\n",
      "\n",
      "11494: For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .\n",
      "\n",
      "11495: She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him ; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody .\n",
      "\n",
      "11499: how acutely did she now feel it !\n",
      "\n",
      "11501: Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing by the servant ' s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy , though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted .\n",
      "\n",
      "11511: repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .\n",
      "\n",
      "11515: Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .\n",
      "\n",
      "11516: An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn .\n",
      "\n",
      "11546: And what claims has Lydia --- what attraction has she beyond youth , health , and good humour that could make him , for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?\n",
      "\n",
      "11554: But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half - year , nay , for a twelvemonth --- she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .\n",
      "\n",
      "11562: And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would think capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?\n",
      "\n",
      "11572: He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11574: can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11580: That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .\n",
      "\n",
      "11585: When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .\n",
      "\n",
      "11589: Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self - reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .\n",
      "\n",
      "11594: Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives .\n",
      "\n",
      "11603: \" And my mother --- how is she ?\n",
      "\n",
      "11616: The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and , perhaps , announce their marriage .\n",
      "\n",
      "11618: \" If I had been able ,\" said she , \" to carry my point in going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her .\n",
      "\n",
      "11620: I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after .\n",
      "\n",
      "11633: And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married .\n",
      "\n",
      "11636: And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .\n",
      "\n",
      "11640: Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .\n",
      "\n",
      "11643: The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business , had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty .\n",
      "\n",
      "11644: As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth , with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table : \" This is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of .\n",
      "\n",
      "11646: Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , \" Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson : that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable ; that one false step involves her in endless ruin ; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11668: Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ' s last letter she had prepared her for such a step .\n",
      "\n",
      "11699: cried Elizabeth when she had finished it .\n",
      "\n",
      "11701: But at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey .\n",
      "\n",
      "11723: And Lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters ', if they should be of use to us .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11724: \" She had better have stayed at home ,\" cried Elizabeth ; \" perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours .\n",
      "\n",
      "11740: Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up --- though , as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham ' s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .\n",
      "\n",
      "11744: Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come when , if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .\n",
      "\n",
      "11755: It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the ---- shire might be able to give more information ; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .\n",
      "\n",
      "11759: But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .\n",
      "\n",
      "11764: And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs . Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .\n",
      "\n",
      "11780: she cried .\n",
      "\n",
      "11785: When Mrs . Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .\n",
      "\n",
      "11787: she cried .\n",
      "\n",
      "11790: As Mrs . Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and the children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it .\n",
      "\n",
      "11795: The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia ' s infamy somewhat better .\n",
      "\n",
      "11796: It would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .\n",
      "\n",
      "11827: Chapter 49 Two days after Mr . Bennet ' s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , \" I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11864: cried Elizabeth , when she had finished .\n",
      "\n",
      "11871: Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he wrote .\n",
      "\n",
      "11873: my dear father ,\" she cried , \" come back and write immediately .\n",
      "\n",
      "11916: By this time she is actually with them !\n",
      "\n",
      "11917: If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !\n",
      "\n",
      "11918: What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "11934: She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation .\n",
      "\n",
      "11938: she cried .\n",
      "\n",
      "11957: \" For we must attribute this happy conclusion ,\" she added , \" in a great measure to his kindness .\n",
      "\n",
      "11966: And she was only sixteen last June .\n",
      "\n",
      "11970: One day ' s delay , she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual .\n",
      "\n",
      "11972: \" I will go to Meryton ,\" said she , \" as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips .\n",
      "\n",
      "11982: Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .\n",
      "\n",
      "11983: Poor Lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .\n",
      "\n",
      "11984: She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister , in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .\n",
      "\n",
      "11985: Chapter 50 Mr . Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .\n",
      "\n",
      "12009: It was a fortnight since Mrs . Bennet had been downstairs ; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .\n",
      "\n",
      "12013: \" Haye Park might do ,\" said she , \" if the Gouldings could quit it --- or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off !\n",
      "\n",
      "12021: He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion .\n",
      "\n",
      "12023: That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all she could believe possible .\n",
      "\n",
      "12025: Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot .\n",
      "\n",
      "12027: There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but , at the same time , there was no one whose knowledge of a sister ' s frailty would have mortified her so much --- not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself , for , at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .\n",
      "\n",
      "12029: From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink .\n",
      "\n",
      "12030: The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .\n",
      "\n",
      "12031: She was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what .\n",
      "\n",
      "12032: She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .\n",
      "\n",
      "12034: She was convinced that she could have been happy with him , when it was no longer likely they should meet .\n",
      "\n",
      "12035: What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been most gladly and gratefully received !\n",
      "\n",
      "12036: He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex ; but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .\n",
      "\n",
      "12039: It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved ; and from his judgement , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .\n",
      "\n",
      "12042: How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .\n",
      "\n",
      "12043: But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .\n",
      "\n",
      "12057: They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South .\n",
      "\n",
      "12060: Lydia ' s being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and , besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody , and had so many favourites .\n",
      "\n",
      "12061: \" She is so fond of Mrs . Forster ,\" said she , \" it will be quite shocking to send her away !\n",
      "\n",
      "12062: And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .\n",
      "\n",
      "12064: His daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .\n",
      "\n",
      "12065: But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .\n",
      "\n",
      "12066: And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North .\n",
      "\n",
      "12068: Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .\n",
      "\n",
      "12069: Chapter 51 Their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "12071: Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets , and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .\n",
      "\n",
      "12075: Lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "12082: She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations ; and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .\n",
      "\n",
      "12084: Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .\n",
      "\n",
      "12087: The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .\n",
      "\n",
      "12090: \" Only think of its being three months ,\" she cried , \" since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .\n",
      "\n",
      "12096: Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , \" Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "12100: She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour .\n",
      "\n",
      "12103: It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first .\n",
      "\n",
      "12105: She longed to see Mrs . Phillips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called \" Mrs . Wickham \" by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to show her ring , and boast of being married , to Mrs . Hill and the two housemaids .\n",
      "\n",
      "12106: \" Well , mamma ,\" said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , \" and what do you think of my husband ?\n",
      "\n",
      "12127: No one but Mrs . Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .\n",
      "\n",
      "12130: She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .\n",
      "\n",
      "12133: He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September , than any body else in the country .\n",
      "\n",
      "12134: One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth : \" Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe .\n",
      "\n",
      "12146: And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .\n",
      "\n",
      "12177: Conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .\n",
      "\n",
      "12180: \" You may readily comprehend ,\" she added , \" what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .\n",
      "\n",
      "12182: \" Not that I shall , though ,\" she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; \" and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12183: Jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ;-- till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .\n",
      "\n",
      "12184: Chapter 52 Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could .\n",
      "\n",
      "12185: She was no sooner in possession of it than , hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .\n",
      "\n",
      "12208: She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .\n",
      "\n",
      "12209: Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .\n",
      "\n",
      "12214: But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .\n",
      "\n",
      "12215: She cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving Wickham .\n",
      "\n",
      "12252: He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ' s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain .\n",
      "\n",
      "12253: I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .\n",
      "\n",
      "12254: If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen .\n",
      "\n",
      "12270: The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !\n",
      "\n",
      "12274: But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her --- for a woman who had already refused him --- as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham .\n",
      "\n",
      "12280: It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .\n",
      "\n",
      "12284: how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .\n",
      "\n",
      "12285: For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him .\n",
      "\n",
      "12289: She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "12290: She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by Wickham .\n",
      "\n",
      "12293: \" You certainly do ,\" she replied with a smile ; \" but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12304: Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me .\n",
      "\n",
      "12305: But of course she did not mention my name to you .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12306: \" Yes , she did .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12307: \" And what did she say ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12308: \" That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had --- not turned out well .\n",
      "\n",
      "12311: Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said : \" I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month .\n",
      "\n",
      "12322: \" I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .\n",
      "\n",
      "12323: When I last saw her , she was not very promising .\n",
      "\n",
      "12325: I hope she will turn out well .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12326: \" I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12346: They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling , for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good - humoured smile : \" Come , Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .\n",
      "\n",
      "12350: Chapter 53 Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .\n",
      "\n",
      "12353: my dear Lydia ,\" she cried , \" when shall we meet again ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12369: \" I often think ,\" said she , \" that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends .\n",
      "\n",
      "12374: Lydia does not leave me because she is married , but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off .\n",
      "\n",
      "12375: If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12389: \" You may depend on it ,\" replied the other , \" for Mrs . Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true .\n",
      "\n",
      "12391: She was going to the butcher ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12393: It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said : \" I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed .\n",
      "\n",
      "12400: Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it .\n",
      "\n",
      "12401: \" Yet it is hard ,\" she sometimes thought , \" that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !\n",
      "\n",
      "12404: They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .\n",
      "\n",
      "12419: Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley , in consequence of it , before they did .\n",
      "\n",
      "12422: My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much I suffer from what she says .\n",
      "\n",
      "12429: But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him , from her dressing - room window , enter the paddock and ride towards the house .\n",
      "\n",
      "12431: Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window --- she looked ,-- she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "12446: But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . Gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .\n",
      "\n",
      "12447: To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley .\n",
      "\n",
      "12448: Her astonishment at his coming --- at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire .\n",
      "\n",
      "12449: The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .\n",
      "\n",
      "12450: But she would not be secure .\n",
      "\n",
      "12451: \" Let me first see how he behaves ,\" said she ; \" it will then be early enough for expectation .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12454: On the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance .\n",
      "\n",
      "12457: He looked serious , as usual ; and , she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley .\n",
      "\n",
      "12460: Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .\n",
      "\n",
      "12463: Darcy , after inquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely anything .\n",
      "\n",
      "12466: But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised he eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .\n",
      "\n",
      "12470: said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "12472: She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .\n",
      "\n",
      "12484: to Miss Lydia Bennet ,' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything .\n",
      "\n",
      "12489: How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .\n",
      "\n",
      "12495: Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .\n",
      "\n",
      "12496: It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .\n",
      "\n",
      "12501: Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .\n",
      "\n",
      "12502: At that instant , she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion .\n",
      "\n",
      "12503: \" The first wish of my heart ,\" said she to herself , \" is never more to be in company with either of them .\n",
      "\n",
      "12508: He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .\n",
      "\n",
      "12509: Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .\n",
      "\n",
      "12510: But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .\n",
      "\n",
      "12512: \" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley ,\" she added , \" for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .\n",
      "\n",
      "12516: Mrs . Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year .\n",
      "\n",
      "12519: \" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent ,\" said she , \" did he come at all ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12527: \" Now ,\" said she , \" that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .\n",
      "\n",
      "12542: He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half - laughing alarm .\n",
      "\n",
      "12544: Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .\n",
      "\n",
      "12545: It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour .\n",
      "\n",
      "12549: She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did .\n",
      "\n",
      "12550: Her mother ' s ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at times , have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .\n",
      "\n",
      "12554: \" If he does not come to me , then ,\" said she , \" I shall give him up for ever .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12555: The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas !\n",
      "\n",
      "12565: She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying : \" Is your sister at Pemberley still ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12566: \" Yes , she will remain there till Christmas .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12575: They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "12576: Mrs . Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .\n",
      "\n",
      "12577: \" Well girls ,\" said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , \" What say you to the day ?\n",
      "\n",
      "12584: And what do you think she said besides ?\n",
      "\n",
      "12589: Mrs . Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley ' s behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .\n",
      "\n",
      "12611: \" Next time you call ,\" said she , \" I hope we shall be more lucky .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12614: ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .\n",
      "\n",
      "12624: \" We will be down as soon as we can ,\" said Jane ; \" but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12627: what has she to do with it ?\n",
      "\n",
      "12634: Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , \" What is the matter mamma ?\n",
      "\n",
      "12639: She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , \" Come here , my love , I want to speak to you ,\" took her out of the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "12640: Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her entreaty that she would not give in to it .\n",

      "12643: \" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ;\" said her mother , as soon as she was in the hall .\n",
      "\n",
      "12645: Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing - room .\n",
      "\n",
      "12652: Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence .\n",
      "\n",
      "12657: Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother ' s schemes .\n",
      "\n",
      "12658: But on returning to the drawing - room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .\n",
      "\n",
      "12659: On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both , as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other , would have told it all .\n",
      "\n",
      "12660: Their situation was awkward enough ; but her ' s she thought was still worse .\n",
      "\n",
      "12662: Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "12664: she added , \" by far too much .\n",
      "\n",
      "12670: But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said for the present .\n",
      "\n",
      "12671: \" I must go instantly to my mother ;\" she cried .\n",
      "\n",
      "12679: \" And this ,\" said she , \" is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection !\n",
      "\n",
      "12682: In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .\n",
      "\n",
      "12689: They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of Jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super - excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "12692: Mrs . Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour ; and when Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was .\n",
      "\n",
      "12716: At that moment , she cared for no other .\n",
      "\n",
      "12717: Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .\n",
      "\n",
      "12720: Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .\n",
      "\n",
      "12722: \" He has made me so happy ,\" said she , one evening , \" by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !\n",
      "\n",
      "12735: Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .\n",
      "\n",
      "12746: Mrs . Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . Phillips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton .\n",
      "\n",
      "12754: They were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of Mrs . Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt .\n",
      "\n",
      "12758: After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth , \" I hope you are well , Miss Bennet .\n",
      "\n",
      "12760: Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .\n",
      "\n",
      "12771: Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .\n",
      "\n",
      "12772: But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .\n",
      "\n",
      "12776: I think she will be pleased with the hermitage .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12782: said she , as she looked in her face .\n",
      "\n",
      "12844: \" But the wife of Mr . Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12873: Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation : \" I am not .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12898: \" You can now have nothing further to say ,\" she resentfully answered .\n",
      "\n",
      "12901: And she rose as she spoke .\n",
      "\n",
      "12926: In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when , turning hastily round , she added , \" I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .\n",
      "\n",
      "12931: She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .\n",
      "\n",
      "12933: \" She did not choose it ,\" said her daughter , \" she would go .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12936: for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well .\n",
      "\n",
      "12937: She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so , passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you .\n",
      "\n",
      "12938: I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12940: Chapter 57 The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she , for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .\n",
      "\n",
      "12943: but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea .\n",
      "\n",
      "12945: And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge , therefore ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report , she concluded , had reached lady Catherine ), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time .\n",
      "\n",
      "12946: In revolving Lady Catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .\n",
      "\n",
      "12947: From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .\n",
      "\n",
      "12948: She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain that , in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .\n",
      "\n",
      "12953: \" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days ,\" she added , \" I shall know how to understand it .\n",
      "\n",
      "12957: The next morning , as she was going downstairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .\n",
      "\n",
      "12960: It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .\n",
      "\n",
      "12966: The colour now rushed into Elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued : \" You look conscious .\n",
      "\n",
      "12995: \"' After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it become apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .\n",
      "\n",
      "12996: I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned .'\n",
      "\n",
      "13014: Did she call to refuse her consent ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "13015: To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .\n",
      "\n",
      "13017: It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .\n",
      "\n",
      "13018: Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr . Darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .\n",
      "\n",
      "13026: They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone .\n",
      "\n",
      "13027: Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said : \" Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s .\n",
      "\n",
      "13046: Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .\n",
      "\n",
      "13049: She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance ; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give .\n",
      "\n",
      "13053: Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , \" Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .\n",
      "\n",
      "13121: He then told her of Georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .\n",
      "\n",
      "13133: And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .\n",
      "\n",
      "13140: \" Did you speak from your own observation ,\" said she , \" when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "13152: Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "13157: was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .\n",
      "\n",
      "13158: She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .\n",
      "\n",
      "13159: She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor anything else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .\n",
      "\n",
      "13162: Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .\n",
      "\n",
      "13163: She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .\n",
      "\n",
      "13164: At night she opened her heart to Jane .\n",
      "\n",
      "13165: Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .\n",
      "\n",
      "13213: Another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .\n",
      "\n",
      "13215: \" Now I am quite happy ,\" said she , \" for you will be as happy as myself .\n",
      "\n",
      "13223: But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia ' s marriage .\n",
      "\n",
      "13226: cried Mrs . Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , \" if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley !\n",
      "\n",
      "13237: Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .\n",
      "\n",
      "13239: As she went up stairs to get ready , Mrs . Bennet followed her , saying : \" I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .\n",
      "\n",
      "13245: But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .\n",
      "\n",
      "13246: * * * * * In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .\n",
      "\n",
      "13247: She did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy ; and that it should be through her means --- that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her --- was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .\n",
      "\n",
      "13248: In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper , \" Go to your father , he wants you in the library .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "13254: How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !\n",
      "\n",
      "13255: It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy .\n",
      "\n",
      "13262: \" I do , I do like him ,\" she replied , with tears in her eyes , \" I love him .\n",
      "\n",
      "13276: Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months ' suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .\n",
      "\n",
      "13277: \" Well , my dear ,\" said he , when she ceased speaking , \" I have no more to say .\n",
      "\n",
      "13280: To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .\n",
      "\n",
      "13288: He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Mr . Collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go --- saying , as she quitted the room , \" If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "13289: Elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .\n",
      "\n",
      "13291: When her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .\n",
      "\n",
      "13293: Nor was it under many , many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .\n",
      "\n",
      "13321: But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .\n",
      "\n",
      "13322: \" My dearest child ,\" she cried , \" I can think of nothing else !\n",
      "\n",
      "13329: But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs . Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .\n",
      "\n",
      "13333: Chapter 60 Elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .\n",
      "\n",
      "13335: said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "13351: \" Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "13376: \" Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .\n",
      "\n",
      "13381: My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "13387: From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over - rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . Gardiner ' s long letter ; but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : \" I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write .\n",
      "\n",
      "13397: I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh .\n",
      "\n",
      "13410: Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .\n",
      "\n",
      "13416: At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .\n",
      "\n",
      "13420: Mrs . Phillips ' s vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater , tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs . Phillips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .\n",
      "\n",
      "13422: Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .\n",
      "\n",
      "13424: With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs . Bingley , and talked of Mrs . Darcy , may be guessed .\n",
      "\n",
      "13425: I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .\n",
      "\n",
      "13432: In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .\n",
      "\n",
      "13433: She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia ; and , removed from the influence of Lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .\n",
      "\n",
      "13434: From the further disadvantage of Lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .\n",
      "\n",
      "13435: Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . Bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone .\n",
      "\n",
      "13436: Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .\n",
      "\n",
      "13446: As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind .\n",
      "\n",
      "13447: Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .\n",
      "\n",
      "13451: His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her ' s lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .\n",
      "\n",
      "13454: Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ' s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth .\n",
      "\n",
      "13457: Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .\n",
      "\n",
      "13458: He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .\n",
      "\n",
      "13460: By Elizabeth ' s instructions , she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "13461: Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .\n",
      "\n",
      "13462: But at length , by Elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .\n",

      "\n",
      "13518: He really pressed them , with some earnestness , to consider Norland as their home ; and , as no plan appeared so eligible to Mrs . Dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood , his invitation was accepted .\n",
      "\n",
      "13521: But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy , and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy .\n",
      "\n",
      "13526: And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods , who were related to him only by half blood , which she considered as no relationship at all , have on his generosity to so large an amount .\n",
      "\n",
      "13538: Consider ,\" she added , \" that when the money is once parted with , it never can return .\n",
      "\n",
      "13558: \" That is very true , and , therefore , I do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them -- something of the annuity kind I mean .-- My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "13561: \" To be sure ,\" said she , \" it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once .\n",
      "\n",
      "13565: \" Certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty .\n",
      "\n",
      "13568: I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father ' s will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it .\n",
      "\n",
      "13571: Her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother ' s disposal , without any restriction whatever .\n",
      "\n",
      "13604: Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "13615: CHAPTER 3 Mrs . Dashwood remained at Norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland ; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible .\n",
      "\n",
      "13616: But she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease , and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter , whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income , which her mother would have approved .\n",
      "\n",
      "13618: She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself , and she thought of it for her daughters ' sake with satisfaction , though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her in affluence .\n",
      "\n",
      "13619: For their brother ' s sake , too , for the sake of his own heart , she rejoiced ; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before , in believing him incapable of generosity .\n",
      "\n",
      "13620: His attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him , and , for a long time , she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions .\n",
      "\n",
      "13621: The contempt which she had , very early in their acquaintance , felt for her daughter - in - law , was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character , which half a year ' s residence in her family afforded ; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former , the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long , had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility , according to the opinions of Mrs . Dashwood , to her daughters ' continuance at Norland .\n",
      "\n",
      "13638: Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs . Dashwood ' s attention ; for she was , at that time , in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects .\n",
      "\n",
      "13639: She saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive , and she liked him for it .\n",
      "\n",
      "13643: \" It is enough ,\" said she ; \" to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough .\n",
      "\n",
      "13654: She speedily comprehended all his merits ; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration ; but she really felt assured of his worth : and even that quietness of manner , which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man ' s address ought to be , was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate .\n",
      "\n",
      "13655: No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to Elinor , than she considered their serious attachment as certain , and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching .\n",
      "\n",
      "13657: said she , \" Elinor will , in all probability be settled for life .\n",
      "\n",
      "13672: It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter .\n",
      "\n",
      "13680: Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it .\n",
      "\n",
      "13686: Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him .\n",
      "\n",
      "13702: Yet , though smiling within herself at the mistake , she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it .\n",
      "\n",
      "13706: She would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account , and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible .\n",
      "\n",
      "13707: At length she replied : \" Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits .\n",
      "\n",
      "13725: Elinor started at this declaration , and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into , in speaking of him .\n",
      "\n",
      "13727: She believed the regard to be mutual ; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne ' s conviction of their attachment agreeable to her .\n",
      "\n",
      "13730: \" I do not attempt to deny ,\" said she , \" that I think very highly of him -- that I greatly esteem , that I like him .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "13739: \" Excuse me ,\" said she ; \" and be assured that I meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings .\n",
      "\n",
      "13750: said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "13765: Nay , the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard ; and sometimes , for a few painful minutes , she believed it to be no more than friendship .\n",
      "\n",
      "13772: He understood that she was in need of a dwelling ; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage , he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary , if the situation pleased her .\n",
      "\n",
      "13773: He earnestly pressed her , after giving the particulars of the house and garden , to come with her daughters to Barton Park , the place of his own residence , from whence she might judge , herself , whether Barton Cottage , for the houses were in the same parish , could , by any alteration , be made comfortable to her .\n",
      "\n",
      "13774: He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin ; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections .\n",
      "\n",
      "13776: Her resolution was formed as she read .\n",
      "\n",
      "13779: She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness , and her acceptance of his proposal ; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters , that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent .\n",
      "\n",
      "13782: The house , too , as described by Sir John , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence .\n",
      "\n",
      "13783: CHAPTER 5 No sooner was her answer dispatched , than Mrs . Dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son - in - law and his wife that she was provided with a house , and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it .\n",
      "\n",
      "13785: Mrs . John Dashwood said nothing ; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland .\n",
      "\n",
      "13786: She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire .-- Edward turned hastily towards her , on hearing this , and , in a voice of surprise and concern , which required no explanation to her , repeated , \" Devonshire !\n",
      "\n",
      "13792: \" It is but a cottage ,\" she continued , \" but I hope to see many of my friends in it .\n",
      "\n",
      "13794: She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr . and Mrs . John Dashwood to visit her at Barton ; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection .\n",
      "\n",
      "13796: To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show Mrs . John Dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match .\n",
      "\n",
      "13797: Mr . John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture .\n",
      "\n",
      "13800: Mrs . John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh : she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs . Dashwood ' s income would be so trifling in comparison with their own , she should have any handsome article of furniture .\n",
      "\n",
      "13801: Mrs . Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession .\n",
      "\n",
      "13802: No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done .-- The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter .\n",
      "\n",
      "13803: For the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed .\n",
      "\n",
      "13805: The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress ' s arrival ; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs . Dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John ' s description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own .\n",
      "\n",
      "13814: said Marianne , as she wandered alone before the house , on the last evening of their being there ; \" when shall I cease to regret you !-- when learn to feel a home elsewhere !-- Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "13834: With the size and furniture of the house Mrs . Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments .\n",
      "\n",
      "13835: \" As for the house itself , to be sure ,\" said she , \" it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements .\n",
      "\n",
      "13851: Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him , denoting her intention of waiting on Mrs . Dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience ; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite , her ladyship was introduced to them the next day .\n",
      "\n",
      "13855: But they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by shewing that , though perfectly well - bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common - place inquiry or remark .\n",
      "\n",
      "13867: He hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources .\n",
      "\n",
      "13882: Luckily Lady Middleton ' s mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine .\n",
      "\n",
      "13886: Marianne was vexed at it for her sister ' s sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs . Jennings ' s .\n",
      "\n",
      "13892: In the evening , as Marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play .\n",
      "\n",
      "13893: The instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and Marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother ' s account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "13898: He paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste .\n",
      "\n",
      "13899: His pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment .\n",
      "\n",
      "13902: She had only two daughters , both of whom she had lived to see respectably married , and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "13903: In the promotion of this object she was zealously active , as far as her ability reached ; and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance .\n",
      "\n",
      "13905: She rather suspected it to be so , on the very first evening of their being together , from his listening so attentively while she sang to them ; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons ' dining at the cottage , the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again .\n",
      "\n",
      "13909: Mrs . Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married , ever since her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge ; and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl .\n",
      "\n",
      "13911: At the park she laughed at the colonel , and in the cottage at Marianne .\n",
      "\n",
      "13912: To the former her raillery was probably , as far as it regarded only himself , perfectly indifferent ; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible ; and when its object was understood , she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity , or censure its impertinence , for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel ' s advanced years , and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor .\n",
      "\n",
      "13930: \" A woman of seven and twenty ,\" said Marianne , after pausing a moment , \" can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife .\n",
      "\n",
      "13950: \" I have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "13951: \" I rather think you are mistaken , for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "13961: When is she dejected or melancholy ?\n",
      "\n",
      "13962: When does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "13966: Their visitors , except those from Barton Park , were not many ; for , in spite of Sir John ' s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood , and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service , the independence of Mrs . Dashwood ' s spirit overcame the wish of society for her children ; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk .\n",
      "\n",
      "13981: She had raised herself from the ground , but her foot had been twisted in her fall , and she was scarcely able to stand .\n",
      "\n",
      "13988: Mrs . Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged .\n",
      "\n",
      "13989: His name , he replied , was Willoughby , and his present home was at Allenham , from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood .\n",
      "\n",
      "13992: But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise .\n",
      "\n",
      "13995: His name was good , his residence was in their favourite village , and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting - jacket was the most becoming .\n",
      "\n",
      "14015: Was she out with him today ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14023: Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14048: Her form , though not so correct as her sister ' s , in having the advantage of height , was more striking ; and her face was so lovely , that when in the common cant of praise , she was called a beautiful girl , truth was less violently outraged than usually happens .\n",
      "\n",
      "14051: But when this passed away , when her spirits became collected , when she saw that to the perfect good - breeding of the gentleman , he united frankness and vivacity , and above all , when she heard him declare , that of music and dancing he was passionately fond , she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay .\n",
      "\n",
      "14053: She could not be silent when such points were introduced , and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion .\n",
      "\n",
      "14055: Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions , she proceeded to question him on the subject of books ; her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight , that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed , not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works , however disregarded before .\n",
      "\n",
      "14071: \" My love ,\" said her mother , \" you must not be offended with Elinor -- she was only in jest .\n",
      "\n",
      "14072: I should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14091: and as she could not even wish him successful , she heartily wished him indifferent .\n",
      "\n",
      "14092: She liked him -- in spite of his gravity and reserve , she beheld in him an object of interest .\n",
      "\n",
      "14094: Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments , which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man , and she regarded him with respect and compassion .\n",
      "\n",
      "14095: Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne , who , prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young , seemed resolved to undervalue his merits .\n",
      "\n",
      "14136: When he was present she had no eyes for any one else .\n",
      "\n",
      "14145: Her heart was devoted to Willoughby , and the fond attachment to Norland , which she brought with her from Sussex , was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before , by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home .\n",
      "\n",
      "14148: They afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind , nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than ever .\n",
      "\n",
      "14149: Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs . Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse .\n",
      "\n",
      "14150: She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times ; and had Elinor ' s memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr . Jenning ' s last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died .\n",
      "\n",
      "14153: Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them ; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired .\n",
      "\n",
      "14154: She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before .\n",
      "\n",
      "14155: Her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home ;-- and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys .\n",
      "\n",
      "14160: Elinor ' s compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him .\n",
      "\n",
      "14164: \" Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14165: \" I believe she does .\n",
      "\n",
      "14166: But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , I know not .\n",
      "\n",
      "14185: CHAPTER 12 As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister , which in spite of all that she knew before of Marianne ' s imprudence and want of thought , surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both .\n",
      "\n",
      "14187: Without considering that it was not in her mother ' s plan to keep any horse , that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift , she must buy another for the servant , and keep a servant to ride it , and after all , build a stable to receive them , she had accepted the present without hesitation , and told her sister of it in raptures .\n",
      "\n",
      "14188: \" He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it ,\" she added , \" and when it arrives we will ride every day .\n",
      "\n",
      "14191: Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair ; and for some time she refused to submit to them .\n",
      "\n",
      "14192: As to an additional servant , the expense would be a trifle ; Mamma she was sure would never object to it ; and any horse would do for HIM ; he might always get one at the park ; as to a stable , the merest shed would be sufficient .\n",
      "\n",
      "14195: \" You are mistaken , Elinor ,\" said she warmly , \" in supposing I know very little of Willoughby .\n",
      "\n",
      "14204: But by an appeal to her affection for her mother , by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself , if ( as would probably be the case ) she consented to this increase of establishment , Marianne was shortly subdued ; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer , and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next , that it must be declined .\n",
      "\n",
      "14210: This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood ; and in the whole of the sentence , in his manner of pronouncing it , and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone , she instantly saw an intimacy so decided , a meaning so direct , as marked a perfect agreement between them .\n",
      "\n",
      "14211: From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident .\n",
      "\n",
      "14213: Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them , and Margaret , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and Marianne , had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face , she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves .\n",
      "\n",
      "14215: she cried , \" I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne .\n",
      "\n",
      "14216: I am sure she will be married to Mr . Willoughby very soon .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14225: For such particulars , stated on such authority , Elinor could not withhold her credit ; nor was she disposed to it , for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "14230: She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs . Jennings .\n",
      "\n",
      "14231: Marianne felt for her most sincerely ; but she did more harm than good to the cause , by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to Margaret , \" Remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14244: \" Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F .\" Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing , at this moment , \" that it rained very hard ,\" though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her , than from her ladyship ' s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother .\n",
      "\n",
      "14278: And I hope she is well .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14345: Then , lowering her voice a little , she said to Elinor , \" She is his natural daughter .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14347: \" Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare .\n",
      "\n",
      "14350: The carriages were then ordered ; Willoughby ' s was first , and Marianne never looked happier than when she got into it .\n",
      "\n",
      "14356: Mrs . Jennings sat on Elinor ' s right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and Willoughby , and said to Marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , \" I have found you out in spite of all your tricks .\n",
      "\n",
      "14363: Mrs . Jennings laughed heartily ; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr . Willoughby ' s groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house .\n",
      "\n",
      "14365: As soon as they left the dining - room , Elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by Mrs . Jennings was perfectly true .\n",
      "\n",
      "14380: She blushed at this hint ; but it was even visibly gratifying to her ; and after a ten minutes ' interval of earnest thought , she came to her sister again , and said with great good humour , \" Perhaps , Elinor , it WAS rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr . Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you .-- There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful .\n",
      "\n",
      "14384: Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others , she would have described every room in the house with equal delight .\n",
      "\n",
      "14385: CHAPTER 14 The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon ' s visit at the park , with his steadiness in concealing its cause , filled the mind , and raised the wonder of Mrs . Jennings for two or three days ; she was a great wonderer , as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance .\n",
      "\n",
      "14387: \" Something very melancholy must be the matter , I am sure ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "14396: May be she is ill in town ; nothing in the world more likely , for I have a notion she is always rather sickly .\n",
      "\n",
      "14405: Elinor , though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon , could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away , which Mrs . Jennings was desirous of her feeling ; for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation , her wonder was otherwise disposed of .\n",
      "\n",
      "14411: But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement , which in fact concealed nothing at all , she could not account ; and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice , that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged , and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne .\n",
      "\n",
      "14423: \" May she always be poor , if she can employ her riches no better .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14436: Mrs . Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne , whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby , as plainly denoted how well she understood him .\n",
      "\n",
      "14457: So far it was all as she had foreseen ; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect .\n",
      "\n",
      "14459: Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only Willoughby , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his back towards them .\n",
      "\n",
      "14462: cried Mrs . Dashwood as she entered --\" is she ill ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14493: One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side ; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister ;-- the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for , though when she considered what Marianne ' s love for him was , a quarrel seemed almost impossible .\n",
      "\n",
      "14494: But whatever might be the particulars of their separation , her sister ' s affliction was indubitable ; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief , but feeding and encouraging as a duty .\n",
      "\n",
      "14496: \" Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton , Elinor ,\" said she , as she sat down to work , \" and with how heavy a heart does he travel ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14513: I am persuaded that Mrs . Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him ,) and on that account is eager to get him away ;-- and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him .\n",
      "\n",
      "14515: He is , moreover , aware that she DOES disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while .\n",
      "\n",
      "14588: They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time , when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word .\n",
      "\n",
      "14590: She avoided the looks of them all , could neither eat nor speak , and after some time , on her mother ' s silently pressing her hand with tender compassion , her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome , she burst into tears and left the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "14592: She was without any power , because she was without any desire of command over herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "14594: CHAPTER 16 Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby .\n",
      "\n",
      "14595: She would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning , had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it .\n",
      "\n",
      "14597: She was awake the whole night , and she wept the greatest part of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "14600: When breakfast was over she walked out by herself , and wandered about the village of Allenham , indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "14602: She played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby , every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined , and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her , till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained ; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied .\n",
      "\n",
      "14604: In books too , as well as in music , she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving .\n",
      "\n",
      "14606: Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever ; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy ; but these employments , to which she daily recurred , her solitary walks and silent meditations , still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever .\n",
      "\n",
      "14609: But Mrs . Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them , which at least satisfied herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "14610: \" Remember , Elinor ,\" said she , \" how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post , and carries them to it .\n",
      "\n",
      "14612: Elinor could not deny the truth of this , and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence .\n",
      "\n",
      "14613: But there was one method so direct , so simple , and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair , and of instantly removing all mystery , that she could not help suggesting it to her mother .\n",
      "\n",
      "14614: \" Why do you not ask Marianne at once ,\" said she , \" whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby ?\n",
      "\n",
      "14622: I know Marianne ' s heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible .\n",
      "\n",
      "14630: Mrs . Dashwood was sorry for what she had said ; but it gave Elinor pleasure , as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions .\n",
      "\n",
      "14632: Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles .\n",
      "\n",
      "14633: If her sisters intended to walk on the downs , she directly stole away towards the lanes ; if they talked of the valley , she was as speedy in climbing the hills , and could never be found when the others set off .\n",
      "\n",
      "14634: But at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor , who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion .\n",
      "\n",
      "14645: She walked eagerly on as she spoke ; and Elinor , to screen Marianne from particularity , as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby , quickened her pace and kept up with her .\n",
      "\n",
      "14647: Marianne looked again ; her heart sunk within her ; and abruptly turning round , she was hurrying back , when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her ; a third , almost as well known as Willoughby ' s , joined them in begging her to stop , and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars .\n",
      "\n",
      "14648: He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby ; the only one who could have gained a smile from her ; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM , and in her sister ' s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment .\n",
      "\n",
      "14651: To Marianne , indeed , the meeting between Edward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour .\n",
      "\n",
      "14659: she repeated , surprised at his being so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing her before .\n",
      "\n",
      "14676: -- As she said this , she sunk into a reverie for a few moments ;-- but rousing herself again , \" Now , Edward ,\" said she , calling his attention to the prospect , \" here is Barton valley .\n",
      "\n",
      "14687: said Marianne to herself as she walked on .\n",
      "\n",
      "14697: His coldness and reserve mortified her severely ; she was vexed and half angry ; but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present , she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure , and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection .\n",
      "\n",
      "14707: said she , when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire ; \" are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14745: Marianne coloured as she replied , \" But most people do .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14753: Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point .\n",
      "\n",
      "14759: And books !-- Thomson , Cowper , Scott -- she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , I believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree .\n",
      "\n",
      "14771: \" Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see ,\" said Elinor , \" she is not at all altered .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14772: \" She is only grown a little more grave than she was .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14778: \" Nor do I think it a part of Marianne ' s ,\" said Elinor ; \" I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14808: Elinor looked surprised at his emotion ; but trying to laugh off the subject , she said to him , \" Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ?\n",
      "\n",
      "14809: Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14814: It was evident that he was unhappy ; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring ; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain ; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one .\n",
      "\n",
      "14815: He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast - room the next morning before the others were down ; and Marianne , who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could , soon left them to themselves .\n",
      "\n",
      "14816: But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open , and , turning round , was astonished to see Edward himself come out .\n",
      "\n",
      "14819: This was a subject which ensured Marianne ' s attention , and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes , and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him , when Edward interrupted her by saying , \" You must not enquire too far , Marianne -- remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque , and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars .\n",
      "\n",
      "14844: \" I never saw you wear a ring before , Edward ,\" she cried .\n",
      "\n",
      "14848: Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt -- but when she saw how much she had pained Edward , her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his .\n",
      "\n",
      "14852: That the hair was her own , she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne ; the only difference in their conclusions was , that what Marianne considered as a free gift from her sister , Elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "14853: She was not in a humour , however , to regard it as an affront , and affecting to take no notice of what passed , by instantly talking of something else , she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself , beyond all doubt , that it was exactly the shade of her own .\n",
      "\n",
      "14856: Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said ; but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy , had she known how little offence it had given her sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "14859: But , as it was , she only learned , from some very significant looks , how far their penetration , founded on Margaret ' s instructions , extended .\n",
      "\n",
      "14864: \" And who knows but you may raise a dance ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "14885: Marianne was surprised and confused , yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner , and after a moment ' s silence , said , \" Oh , Edward !\n",
      "\n",
      "14896: Disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for Willoughby ' s service , by her mother .\n",
      "\n",
      "14901: But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward ' s affection , to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton , and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger .\n",
      "\n",
      "14929: But as it was her determination to subdue it , and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away , she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne , on a similar occasion , to augment and fix her sorrow , by seeking silence , solitude and idleness .\n",
      "\n",
      "14931: Elinor sat down to her drawing - table as soon as he was out of the house , busily employed herself the whole day , neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name , appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family , and if , by this conduct , she did not lessen her own grief , it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase , and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account .\n",
      "\n",
      "14933: The business of self - command she settled very easily ;-- with strong affections it was impossible , with calm ones it could have no merit .\n",
      "\n",
      "14934: That her sister ' s affections WERE calm , she dared not deny , though she blushed to acknowledge it ; and of the strength of her own , she gave a very striking proof , by still loving and respecting that sister , in spite of this mortifying conviction .\n",
      "\n",
      "14938: From a reverie of this kind , as she sat at her drawing - table , she was roused one morning , soon after Edward ' s leaving them , by the arrival of company .\n",
      "\n",
      "14940: The closing of the little gate , at the entrance of the green court in front of the house , drew her eyes to the window , and she saw a large party walking up to the door .\n",
      "\n",
      "14951: As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes , without taking that liberty , she begged to be excused .\n",
      "\n",
      "14953: Has she run away because we are come ?\n",
      "\n",
      "14956: They were now joined by Mrs . Jennings , who had not patience enough to wait till the door was opened before she told HER story .\n",
      "\n",
      "14966: I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again \"-- Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs . Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs . Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John .\n",
      "\n",
      "14970: She came in with a smile , smiled all the time of her visit , except when she laughed , and smiled when she went away .\n",
      "\n",
      "14985: \" Mr . Palmer does not hear me ,\" said she , laughing ; \" he never does sometimes .\n",
      "\n",
      "14987: This was quite a new idea to Mrs . Dashwood ; she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one , and could not help looking with surprise at them both .\n",
      "\n",
      "14988: Mrs . Jennings , in the meantime , talked on as loud as she could , and continued her account of their surprise , the evening before , on seeing their friends , without ceasing till every thing was told .\n",
      "\n",
      "14990: \" You may believe how glad we all were to see them ,\" added Mrs . Jennings , leaning forward towards Elinor , and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else , though they were seated on different sides of the room ; \" but , however , I can ' t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation .\n",
      "\n",
      "14991: I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "14999: Mrs . Jennings asked her , as soon as she appeared , if she had not been to Allenham ; and Mrs . Palmer laughed so heartily at the question , as to show she understood it .\n",
      "\n",
      "15009: And then sitting down again , she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "15020: Lady Middleton too , though she did not press their mother , pressed them .\n",
      "\n",
      "15031: said she , seating herself between Elinor and Marianne , \" for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come , which would be a shocking thing , as we go away again tomorrow .\n",
      "\n",
      "15080: Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid of her ; and exultingly said , she did not care how cross he was to her , as they must live together .\n",
      "\n",
      "15082: The studied indifference , insolence , and discontent of her husband gave her no pain ; and when he scolded or abused her , she was highly diverted .\n",
      "\n",
      "15084: said she , in a whisper , to Elinor .\n",
      "\n",
      "15087: His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding , like many others of his sex , that through some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty , he was the husband of a very silly woman ,-- but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it .-- It was rather a wish of distinction , she believed , which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body , and his general abuse of every thing before him .\n",
      "\n",
      "15105: Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the hardship of such an obligation .\n",
      "\n",
      "15113: \" He cannot bear writing , you know ,\" she continued --\" he says it is quite shocking .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15119: She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing - room , by asking her whether she did not like Mr . Palmer excessively .\n",
      "\n",
      "15124: She thought it probable that as they lived in the same county , Mrs . Palmer might be able to give some more particular account of Willoughby ' s general character , than could be gathered from the Middletons ' partial acquaintance with him ; and she was eager to gain from any one , such a confirmation of his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne .\n",
      "\n",
      "15163: She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her .\n",
      "\n",
      "15175: I believe ,\" she added in a low voice , \" he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could .\n",
      "\n",
      "15187: Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation , and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of Sir John , by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life , and of whose elegance ,-- whose tolerable gentility even , she could have no proof ; for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "15188: Their being her relations too made it so much the worse ; and Mrs . Jennings ' s attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded , when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable ; because they were all cousins and must put up with one another .\n",
      "\n",
      "15200: The children are all hanging about her already , as if she was an old acquaintance .\n",
      "\n",
      "15209: When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place , they found in the appearance of the eldest , who was nearly thirty , with a very plain and not a sensible face , nothing to admire ; but in the other , who was not more than two or three and twenty , they acknowledged considerable beauty ; her features were pretty , and she had a sharp quick eye , and a smartness of air , which though it did not give actual elegance or grace , gave distinction to her person .-- Their manners were particularly civil , and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense , when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton .\n",
      "\n",
      "15210: With her children they were in continual raptures , extolling their beauty , courting their notice , and humouring their whims ; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it , was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing , if she happened to be doing any thing , or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress , in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight .\n",
      "\n",
      "15211: Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles , a fond mother , though , in pursuit of praise for her children , the most rapacious of human beings , is likewise the most credulous ; her demands are exorbitant ; but she will swallow any thing ; and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust .\n",
      "\n",
      "15216: said she , on his taking Miss Steeles ' s pocket handkerchief , and throwing it out of window --\" He is full of monkey tricks .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15217: And soon afterwards , on the second boy ' s violently pinching one of the same lady ' s fingers , she fondly observed , \" How playful William is !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15218: \" And here is my sweet little Annamaria ,\" she added , tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old , who had not made a noise for the last two minutes ; \" And she is always so gentle and quiet -- Never was there such a quiet little thing !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15231: Marianne was silent ; it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel , however trivial the occasion ; and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it , always fell .\n",
      "\n",
      "15232: She did her best when thus called on , by speaking of Lady Middleton with more warmth than she felt , though with far less than Miss Lucy .\n",
      "\n",
      "15243: In some surprise at the familiarity of this question , or at least of the manner in which it was spoken , Elinor replied that she was .\n",
      "\n",
      "15264: And then to turn the discourse , she began admiring the house and the furniture .\n",
      "\n",
      "15266: The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation , and as Elinor was not blinded by the beauty , or the shrewd look of the youngest , to her want of real elegance and artlessness , she left the house without any wish of knowing them better .\n",
      "\n",
      "15269: To do him justice , he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve , by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins ' situations in the most delicate particulars ,-- and Elinor had not seen them more than twice , before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister ' s having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton .\n",
      "\n",
      "15270: \"' Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure ,\" said she , \" and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome .\n",
      "\n",
      "15274: The Miss Steeles , as she expected , had now all the benefit of these jokes , and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to , which , though often impertinently expressed , was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness into the concerns of their family .\n",
      "\n",
      "15289: She wished very much to have the subject continued , though she did not chuse to join in it herself ; but nothing more of it was said , and for the first time in her life , she thought Mrs . Jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information , or in a disposition to communicate it .\n",
      "\n",
      "15292: Lucy was naturally clever ; her remarks were often just and amusing ; and as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable ; but her powers had received no aid from education : she was ignorant and illiterate ; and her deficiency of all mental improvement , her want of information in the most common particulars , could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood , in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage .\n",
      "\n",
      "15293: Elinor saw , and pitied her for , the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable ; but she saw , with less tenderness of feeling , the thorough want of delicacy , of rectitude , and integrity of mind , which her attentions , her assiduities , her flatteries at the Park betrayed ; and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance ; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality , and whose conduct toward others made every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless .\n",
      "\n",
      "15296: Elinor DID think the question a very odd one , and her countenance expressed it , as she answered that she had never seen Mrs . Ferrars .\n",
      "\n",
      "15299: Then , perhaps , you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15301: \" I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way ,\" said Lucy , eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke ; \" but perhaps there may be reasons -- I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15313: She looked down as she said this , amiably bashful , with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her .\n",
      "\n",
      "15318: And she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister - in - law .\n",
      "\n",
      "15322: She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement , unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration ; and though her complexion varied , she stood firm in incredulity , and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit , or a swoon .\n",
      "\n",
      "15328: Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words ; but at length forcing herself to speak , and to speak cautiously , she said , with calmness of manner , which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude -- \" May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15333: \" I did not know ,\" said she , \" that you were even acquainted till the other day .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15344: \" Certainly ,\" answered Elinor , without knowing what she said ; but after a moment ' s reflection , she added , with revived security of Edward ' s honour and love , and her companion ' s falsehood --\" Engaged to Mr . Edward Ferrars !-- I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me , that really -- I beg your pardon ; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name .\n",
      "\n",
      "15353: \" Four years you have been engaged ,\" said she with a firm voice .\n",
      "\n",
      "15357: Then taking a small miniature from her pocket , she added , \" To prevent the possibility of mistake , be so good as to look at this face .\n",
      "\n",
      "15359: She put it into her hands as she spoke ; and when Elinor saw the painting , whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision , or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind , she could have none of its being Edward ' s face .\n",
      "\n",
      "15366: \" I am sure ,\" said she , \" I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say .\n",
      "\n",
      "15367: I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15371: As she said this , she looked earnestly at Lucy , hoping to discover something in her countenance ; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying ; but Lucy ' s countenance suffered no change .\n",
      "\n",
      "15372: \" I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you ,\" said she , \" in telling you all this .\n",
      "\n",
      "15375: Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me .\n",
      "\n",
      "15376: She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t ' other day , when Edward ' s name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all .\n",
      "\n",
      "15381: Here she took out her handkerchief ; but Elinor did not feel very compassionate .\n",
      "\n",
      "15384: As she said this , she looked directly at her companion .\n",
      "\n",
      "15404: Elinor saw that it WAS his hand , and she could doubt no longer .\n",
      "\n",
      "15405: This picture , she had allowed herself to believe , might have been accidentally obtained ; it might not have been Edward ' s gift ; but a correspondence between them by letter , could subsist only under a positive engagement , could be authorised by nothing else ; for a few moments , she was almost overcome -- her heart sunk within her , and she could hardly stand ; but exertion was indispensably necessary ; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings , that her success was speedy , and for the time complete .\n",
      "\n",
      "15411: \" I did ,\" said Elinor , with a composure of voice , under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before .\n",
      "\n",
      "15422: No ; whatever it might once have been , she could not believe it such at present .\n",
      "\n",
      "15437: As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession , she wept for him , more than for herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "15438: Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters .\n",
      "\n",
      "15439: And so well was she able to answer her own expectations , that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes , no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters , that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love , and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man , of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed , and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house .\n",
      "\n",
      "15441: On the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support .\n",
      "\n",
      "15442: From their counsel , or their conversation , she knew she could receive no assistance , their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress , while her self - command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise .\n",
      "\n",
      "15444: Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject , she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it ; and this for more reasons than one .\n",
      "\n",
      "15445: She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again , she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward , whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him , and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy , by her readiness to enter on the matter again , and her calmness in conversing on it , that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend , which she very much feared her involuntary agitation , in their morning discourse , must have left at least doubtful .\n",
      "\n",
      "15448: But indeed , while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward , it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous ; and that she was so , her very confidence was a proof .\n",
      "\n",
      "15450: She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival ' s intentions , and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed , to combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible ; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was unwounded .\n",
      "\n",
      "15451: And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told , she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure .\n",
      "\n",
      "15455: One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles .\n",
      "\n",
      "15456: Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother ' s permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise .\n",
      "\n",
      "15458: The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected ; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression , and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room : to the latter , the children accompanied them , and while they remained there , she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy ' s attention to attempt it .\n",
      "\n",
      "15463: And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to - morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15467: My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed , I know , if the basket was not finished tomorrow , for though I told her it certainly would not , I am sure she depends upon having it done .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15468: Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child .\n",
      "\n",
      "15472: And without farther ceremony , she turned away and walked to the instrument .\n",
      "\n",
      "15473: Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never made so rude a speech .\n",
      "\n",
      "15477: I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15484: The pianoforte at which Marianne , wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts , had by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself , was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely , under the shelter of its noise , introduce the interesting subject , without any risk of being heard at the card - table .\n",
      "\n",
      "15514: \" But what ,\" said she after a short silence , \" are your views ?\n",
      "\n",
      "15526: \" I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood ' s is not ,\" said Mrs . Jennings , laughing heartily ; \" for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who SHE likes .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15552: said she with all her accustomary complacency .\n",
      "\n",
      "15563: Elinor was soon called to the card - table by the conclusion of the first rubber , and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end , to which both of them submitted without any reluctance , for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before ; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife ; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage , which sincere affection on HER side would have given , for self - interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement , of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary .\n",
      "\n",
      "15564: From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor , and when entered on by Lucy , who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it , and was particularly careful to inform her confidante , of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward , it was treated by the former with calmness and caution , and dismissed as soon as civility would allow ; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which Lucy did not deserve , and which were dangerous to herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "15567: CHAPTER 25 Though Mrs . Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends , she was not without a settled habitation of her own .\n",
      "\n",
      "15568: Since the death of her husband , who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town , she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square .\n",
      "\n",
      "15569: Towards this home , she began on the approach of January to turn her thoughts , and thither she one day abruptly , and very unexpectedly by them , asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her .\n",
      "\n",
      "15570: Elinor , without observing the varying complexion of her sister , and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan , immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both , in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations .\n",
      "\n",
      "15578: I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I don ' t get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault .\n",
      "\n",
      "15581: It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it .\n",
      "\n",
      "15589: But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother ,-- I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence -- Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "15592: Mrs . Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs . Dashwood could spare them perfectly well ; and Elinor , who now understood her sister , and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again , made no farther direct opposition to the plan , and merely referred it to her mother ' s decision , from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit , which she could not approve of for Marianne , and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid .\n",
      "\n",
      "15593: Whatever Marianne was desirous of , her mother would be eager to promote -- she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust ; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London .\n",
      "\n",
      "15594: That Marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with Mrs . Jennings ' manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness .\n",
      "\n",
      "15596: \" I am delighted with the plan ,\" she cried , \" it is exactly what I could wish .\n",
      "\n",
      "15607: What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ?\n",
      "\n",
      "15609: \" My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs . Jennings ' s heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15613: Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs . Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours .\n",
      "\n",
      "15614: To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy ' s account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished .\n",
      "\n",
      "15616: You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law ' s family .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15617: Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother ' s dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself , that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed , and now on this attack , though almost hopeless of success , she forced herself to begin her design by saying , as calmly as she could , \" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15619: Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment , and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue .\n",
      "\n",
      "15624: Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel .\n",
      "\n",
      "15625: With regard to herself , it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not , and when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan , and her sister exhilarated by it in look , voice , and manner , restored to all her usual animation , and elevated to more than her usual gaiety , she could not be dissatisfied with the cause , and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence .\n",
      "\n",
      "15633: But these objections had all , with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared , been overcome or overlooked ; and Elinor , in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby ' s constancy , could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of Marianne , without feeling how blank was her own prospect , how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison , and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne ' s situation to have the same animating object in view , the same possibility of hope .\n",
      "\n",
      "15636: Should the result of her observations be unfavourable , she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister ; should it be otherwise , her exertions would be of a different nature -- she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison , and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne .\n",
      "\n",
      "15639: To atone for this conduct therefore , Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself , behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs . Jennings , talked with her , laughed with her , and listened to her whenever she could ; and Mrs . Jennings on her side treated them both with all possible kindness , was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment , and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn , nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod , or boiled fowls to veal cutlets .\n",
      "\n",
      "15647: Elinor said no more ; it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby ; and the conclusion which as instantly followed was , that , however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair , they must be engaged .\n",
      "\n",
      "15648: This conviction , though not entirely satisfactory , gave her pleasure , and she continued her letter with greater alacrity .\n",
      "\n",
      "15650: Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the direction ; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne , ringing the bell , requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the two - penny post .\n",
      "\n",
      "15656: Every thing was silent ; this could not be borne many seconds ; she opened the door , advanced a few steps towards the stairs , and after listening half a minute , returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce ; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming , \" Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15658: It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness , and she immediately left the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "15659: Elinor was disappointed too ; but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her ; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him .\n",
      "\n",
      "15660: She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him , that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room , with such astonishment and concern , as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "15663: Elinor answered in some distress that she was , and then talked of head - aches , low spirits , and over fatigues ; and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister ' s behaviour .\n",
      "\n",
      "15666: Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town , but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival ; and at length , by way of saying something , she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last .\n",
      "\n",
      "15668: This , and the manner in which it was said , immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place , with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs . Jennings , and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt .\n",
      "\n",
      "15671: Colonel ,\" said she , with her usual noisy cheerfulness , \" I am monstrous glad to see you -- sorry I could not come before -- beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with -- Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner !\n",
      "\n",
      "15676: I warrant you she is a fine size by this time .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15698: They had not long finished their breakfast before Mrs . Palmer ' s barouche stopped at the door , and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room : so delighted to see them all , that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again .\n",
      "\n",
      "15699: So surprised at their coming to town , though it was what she had rather expected all along ; so angry at their accepting her mother ' s invitation after having declined her own , though at the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come !\n",
      "\n",
      "15700: \" Mr . Palmer will be so happy to see you ,\" said she ; \" What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma ?\n",
      "\n",
      "15702: After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat , or in other words , in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs . Jennings ' s side , and in laughter without cause on Mrs . Palmer ' s , it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning , to which Mrs . Jennings and Elinor readily consented , as having likewise some purchases to make themselves ; and Marianne , though declining it at first was induced to go likewise .\n",
      "\n",
      "15703: Wherever they went , she was evidently always on the watch .\n",
      "\n",
      "15705: Restless and dissatisfied every where , her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase , however it might equally concern them both : she received no pleasure from anything ; was only impatient to be at home again , and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs . Palmer , whose eye was caught by every thing pretty , expensive , or new ; who was wild to buy all , could determine on none , and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision .\n",
      "\n",
      "15706: It was late in the morning before they returned home ; and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs , and when Elinor followed , she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance , which declared that no Willoughby had been there .\n",
      "\n",
      "15708: said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels .\n",
      "\n",
      "15711: she replied .\n",
      "\n",
      "15715: said she , in a low and disappointed voice , as she turned away to the window .\n",
      "\n",
      "15718: \" If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him , as she did ; she would have written to Combe Magna ; and if he is in town , how odd that he should neither come nor write !\n",
      "\n",
      "15722: She determined , after some consideration , that if appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were , she would represent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair .\n",
      "\n",
      "15723: Mrs . Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs . Jennings ' s intimate acquaintance , whom she had met and invited in the morning , dined with them .\n",
      "\n",
      "15725: Marianne was of no use on these occasions , as she would never learn the game ; but though her time was therefore at her own disposal , the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor , for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment .\n",
      "\n",
      "15726: She sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read ; but the book was soon thrown aside , and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room , pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window , in hopes of distinguishing the long - expected rap .\n",
      "\n",
      "15730: \" That is true ,\" cried Marianne , in a cheerful voice , and walking to the window as she spoke , to examine the day .\n",
      "\n",
      "15734: \" It is charming weather for THEM indeed ,\" she continued , as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance .\n",
      "\n",
      "15740: \" At any rate ,\" said Elinor , wishing to prevent Mrs . Jennings from seeing her sister ' s thoughts as clearly as she did , \" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15743: \" And now ,\" silently conjectured Elinor , \" she will write to Combe by this day ' s post .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15744: But if she DID , the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact .\n",
      "\n",
      "15745: Whatever the truth of it might be , and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it , yet while she saw Marianne in spirits , she could not be very uncomfortable herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "15755: Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan , and excepting a few old city friends , whom , to Lady Middleton ' s regret , she had never dropped , she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions .\n",
      "\n",
      "15756: Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected , Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties , which , whether at home or abroad , formed only for cards , could have little to amuse her .\n",
      "\n",
      "15785: Elinor , distressed by this charge of reserve in herself , which she was not at liberty to do away , knew not how , under such circumstances , to press for greater openness in Marianne .\n",
      "\n",
      "15786: Mrs . Jennings soon appeared , and the note being given her , she read it aloud .\n",
      "\n",
      "15789: The invitation was accepted ; but when the hour of appointment drew near , necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs . Jennings , that they should both attend her on such a visit , Elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go , for still she had seen nothing of Willoughby ; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad , than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence .\n",
      "\n",
      "15795: Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered : it was enough -- HE was not there -- and she sat down , equally ill - disposed to receive or communicate pleasure .\n",
      "\n",
      "15803: Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life , as she was that evening , and never so much fatigued by the exercise .\n",
      "\n",
      "15810: Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister ' s relief , Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother , and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne , to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed ; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow , that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby , for she could not suppose it to be to any other person .\n",
      "\n",
      "15835: She was not immediately able to say anything , and even when her spirits were recovered , she debated for a short time , on the answer it would be most proper to give .\n",
      "\n",
      "15836: The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known to herself , that in endeavouring to explain it , she might be as liable to say too much as too little .\n",
      "\n",
      "15837: Yet as she was convinced that Marianne ' s affection for Willoughby , could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon ' s success , whatever the event of that affection might be , and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure , she thought it most prudent and kind , after some consideration , to say more than she really knew or believed .\n",
      "\n",
      "15838: She acknowledged , therefore , that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other , of their mutual affection she had no doubt , and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear .\n",
      "\n",
      "15840: Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation , to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points ; she was left , on the contrary , with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon ' s unhappiness , and was prevented even from wishing it removed , by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it .\n",
      "\n",
      "15841: CHAPTER 28 Nothing occurred during the next three or four days , to make Elinor regret what she had done , in applying to her mother ; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote .\n",
      "\n",
      "15842: They were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party , from which Mrs . Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter ; and for this party , Marianne , wholly dispirited , careless of her appearance , and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid , prepared , without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure .\n",
      "\n",
      "15843: She sat by the drawing - room fire after tea , till the moment of Lady Middleton ' s arrival , without once stirring from her seat , or altering her attitude , lost in her own thoughts , and insensible of her sister ' s presence ; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door , she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected .\n",
      "\n",
      "15846: After some time spent in saying little or doing less , Lady Middleton sat down to Cassino , and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about , she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs , placed themselves at no great distance from the table .\n",
      "\n",
      "15850: At that moment she first perceived him , and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight , she would have moved towards him instantly , had not her sister caught hold of her .\n",
      "\n",
      "15852: she exclaimed , \" he is there -- he is there -- Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "15857: This however was more than she could believe herself ; and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne , it was beyond her wish .\n",
      "\n",
      "15859: At last he turned round again , and regarded them both ; she started up , and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection , held out her hand to him .\n",
      "\n",
      "15863: Her face was crimsoned over , and she exclaimed , in a voice of the greatest emotion , \" Good God !\n",
      "\n",
      "15880: \" Go to him , Elinor ,\" she cried , as soon as she could speak , \" and force him to come to me .\n",
      "\n",
      "15886: With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself ; and to persuade her to check her agitation , to wait , at least , with the appearance of composure , till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect , was impossible ; for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings , by exclamations of wretchedness .\n",
      "\n",
      "15888: She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home , as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer .\n",
      "\n",
      "15892: She was soon undressed and in bed , and as she seemed desirous of being alone , her sister then left her , and while she waited the return of Mrs . Jennings , had leisure enough for thinking over the past .\n",
      "\n",
      "15893: That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt , and that Willoughby was weary of it , seemed equally clear ; for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes , SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind .\n",
      "\n",
      "15895: Her indignation would have been still stronger than it was , had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct , and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the affections of her sister from the first , without any design that would bear investigation .\n",
      "\n",
      "15896: Absence might have weakened his regard , and convenience might have determined him to overcome it , but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt .\n",
      "\n",
      "15897: As for Marianne , on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already have given her , and on those still more severe which might await her in its probable consequence , she could not reflect without the deepest concern .\n",
      "\n",
      "15898: Her own situation gained in the comparison ; for while she could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever , however they might be divided in future , her mind might be always supported .\n",
      "\n",
      "15900: CHAPTER 29 Before the house - maid had lit their fire the next day , or the sun gained any power over a cold , gloomy morning in January , Marianne , only half dressed , was kneeling against one of the window - seats for the sake of all the little light she could command from it , and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her .\n",
      "\n",
      "15902: \" No , Elinor ,\" she replied , \" ask nothing ; you will soon know all .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "15903: The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said , lasted no longer than while she spoke , and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction .\n",
      "\n",
      "15904: It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter , and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her , at intervals , to withhold her pen , were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby .\n",
      "\n",
      "15905: Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power ; and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more , had not Marianne entreated her , with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability , not to speak to her for the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "15906: In such circumstances , it was better for both that they should not be long together ; and the restless state of Marianne ' s mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed , but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place , made her wander about the house till breakfast time , avoiding the sight of every body .\n",
      "\n",
      "15907: At breakfast she neither ate , nor attempted to eat any thing ; and Elinor ' s attention was then all employed , not in urging her , not in pitying her , nor in appearing to regard her , but in endeavouring to engage Mrs . Jenning ' s notice entirely to herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "15908: As this was a favourite meal with Mrs . Jennings , it lasted a considerable time , and they were just setting themselves , after it , round the common working table , when a letter was delivered to Marianne , which she eagerly caught from the servant , and , turning of a death - like paleness , instantly ran out of the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "15909: Elinor , who saw as plainly by this , as if she had seen the direction , that it must come from Willoughby , felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head , and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs . Jenning ' s notice .\n",
      "\n",
      "15910: That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking .\n",
      "\n",
      "15911: Of Elinor ' s distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said , \" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life !\n",
      "\n",
      "15912: MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature .\n",
      "\n",
      "15927: Mrs . Jennings laughed again , but Elinor had not spirits to say more , and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written , hurried away to their room , where , on opening the door , she saw Marianne stretched on the bed , almost choked by grief , one letter in her hand , and two or three others laying by her .\n",
      "\n",
      "15929: The latter , though unable to speak , seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour , and after some time thus spent in joint affliction , she put all the letters into Elinor ' s hands ; and then covering her face with her handkerchief , almost screamed with agony .\n",
      "\n",
      "15939: Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever -- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy .\n",
      "\n",
      "15940: She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important .\n",
      "\n",
      "15941: In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs . Jennings ' s chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one .\n",
      "\n",
      "15942: Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs . Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed .\n",
      "\n",
      "15943: Mrs . Jennings , with a thoroughly good - humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and Elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to Marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ; for it was many days since she had any appetite , and many nights since she had really slept ; and now , when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense , the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head , a weakened stomach , and a general nervous faintness .\n",
      "\n",
      "15944: A glass of wine , which Elinor procured for her directly , made her more comfortable , and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness , by saying , \" Poor Elinor !\n",
      "\n",
      "15950: \" Exert yourself , dear Marianne ,\" she cried , \" if you would not kill yourself and all who love you .\n",
      "\n",
      "16015: But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their having been written at all ; and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness , not warranted by anything preceding , and most severely condemned by the event , when Marianne , perceiving that she had finished the letters , observed to her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the same situation .\n",
      "\n",
      "16016: \" I felt myself ,\" she added , \" to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16026: For a moment or two she could say no more ; but when this emotion had passed away , she added , in a firmer tone , \" Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16031: This woman of whom he writes -- whoever she be -- or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and Edward , may have been so barbarous to bely me .\n",
      "\n",
      "16044: Elinor was employed in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window , from the window to the fire , without knowing that she received warmth from one , or discerning objects through the other ; and Marianne , seated at the foot of the bed , with her head leaning against one of its posts , again took up Willoughby ' s letter , and , after shuddering over every sentence , exclaimed -- \" It is too much !\n",
      "\n",
      "16054: \" And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been ?-- how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her !-- Who is she ?-- Who can she be ?-- Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance ?-- Oh !\n",
      "\n",
      "16070: Elinor advised her to lie down again , and for a moment she did so ; but no attitude could give her ease ; and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another , till growing more and more hysterical , her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all , and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance .\n",
      "\n",
      "16071: Some lavender drops , however , which she was at length persuaded to take , were of use ; and from that time till Mrs . Jennings returned , she continued on the bed quiet and motionless .\n",
      "\n",
      "16074: -- said she in a voice of great compassion to Marianne , who turned away her face without attempting to answer .\n",
      "\n",
      "16075: \" How is she , Miss Dashwood ?-- Poor thing !\n",
      "\n",
      "16076: she looks very bad .-- No wonder .\n",
      "\n",
      "16080: Mrs . Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was .\n",
      "\n",
      "16086: I won ' t disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with .\n",
      "\n",
      "16088: She then went away , walking on tiptoe out of the room , as if she supposed her young friend ' s affliction could be increased by noise .\n",
      "\n",
      "16091: But \" no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16092: Elinor , pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive , though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner , said no more ; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could , while Marianne still remained on the bed , was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it .\n",
      "\n",
      "16093: When there , though looking most wretchedly , she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected .\n",
      "\n",
      "16094: Had she tried to speak , or had she been conscious of half Mrs . Jennings ' s well - meant but ill - judged attentions to her , this calmness could not have been maintained ; but not a syllable escaped her lips ; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her .\n",
      "\n",
      "16099: Had not Elinor , in the sad countenance of her sister , seen a check to all mirth , she could have been entertained by Mrs . Jennings ' s endeavours to cure a disappointment in love , by a variety of sweetmeats and olives , and a good fire .\n",
      "\n",
      "16100: As soon , however , as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on Marianne , she could stay no longer .\n",
      "\n",
      "16101: With a hasty exclamation of Misery , and a sign to her sister not to follow her , she directly got up and hurried out of the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "16103: cried Mrs . Jennings , as soon as she was gone , \" how it grieves me to see her !\n",
      "\n",
      "16104: And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine !\n",
      "\n",
      "16108: I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like , I would send all over the town for it .\n",
      "\n",
      "16115: I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man .\n",
      "\n",
      "16126: Is she said to be amiable ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16127: \" I never heard any harm of her ; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned ; except that Mrs . Taylor did say this morning , that one day Miss Walker hinted to her , that she believed Mr . and Mrs . Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married , for she and Mrs . Ellison could never agree .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16130: But now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made !-- What now ,\" after pausing a moment --\" your poor sister is gone to her own room , I suppose , to moan by herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "16135: She hates whist I know ; but is there no round game she cares for ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16138: I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed , for I am sure she wants rest .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16142: no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that .\n",
      "\n",
      "16153: Their own good - nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16168: Elinor , for her sister ' s sake , could not press the subject farther , and she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby ' s ; since , though Marianne might lose much , he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth .\n",
      "\n",
      "16177: Two thousand a year without debt or drawback -- except the little love - child , indeed ; aye , I had forgot her ; but she may be ' prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ?\n",
      "\n",
      "16190: And then rising , she went away to join Marianne , whom she found , as she expected , in her own room , leaning , in silent misery , over the small remains of a fire , which , till Elinor ' s entrance , had been her only light .\n",
      "\n",
      "16193: But this , from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering , she at first refused to do .\n",
      "\n",
      "16194: Her sister ' s earnest , though gentle persuasion , however , soon softened her to compliance , and Elinor saw her lay her aching head on the pillow , and as she hoped , in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her .\n",
      "\n",
      "16195: In the drawing - room , whither she then repaired , she was soon joined by Mrs . Jennings , with a wine - glass , full of something , in her hand .\n",
      "\n",
      "16196: \" My dear ,\" said she , entering , \" I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so I have brought a glass of it for your sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "16203: Mrs . Jennings , though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier , was satisfied with the compromise ; and Elinor , as she swallowed the chief of it , reflected , that though its effects on a colicky gout were , at present , of little importance to her , its healing powers , on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "16205: Mrs . Jennings was not struck by the same thought ; for soon after his entrance , she walked across the room to the tea - table where Elinor presided , and whispered -- \" The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see .\n",
      "\n",
      "16208: \" Marianne is not well ,\" said she .\n",
      "\n",
      "16228: \" It may be so ; but Willoughby is capable -- at least I think \"-- he stopped a moment ; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself , \" And your sister -- how did she --\" \" Her sufferings have been very severe .\n",
      "\n",
      "16231: Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps -- but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her .\n",
      "\n",
      "16236: But your sister does not -- I think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16237: \" You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16240: CHAPTER 31 From a night of more sleep than she had expected , Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes .\n",
      "\n",
      "16241: Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt ; and before breakfast was ready , they had gone through the subject again and again ; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor ' s side , the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on Marianne ' s , as before .\n",
      "\n",
      "16242: Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself , and at others , lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him .\n",
      "\n",
      "16243: At one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world , at another she would seclude herself from it for ever , and at a third could resist it with energy .\n",
      "\n",
      "16244: In one thing , however , she was uniform , when it came to the point , in avoiding , where it was possible , the presence of Mrs . Jennings , and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it .\n",
      "\n",
      "16246: \" No , no , no , it cannot be ,\" she cried ; \" she cannot feel .\n",
      "\n",
      "16248: All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16251: She expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own , and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "16253: With a letter in her outstretched hand , and countenance gaily smiling , from the persuasion of bringing comfort , she entered their room , saying , \" Now , my dear , I bring you something that I am sure will do you good .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16257: The hand writing of her mother , never till then unwelcome , was before her ; and , in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope , she felt as if , till that instant , she had never suffered .\n",
      "\n",
      "16258: The cruelty of Mrs . Jennings no language , within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence , could have expressed ; and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence -- a reproach , however , so entirely lost on its object , that after many expressions of pity , she withdrew , still referring her to the letter of comfort .\n",
      "\n",
      "16259: But the letter , when she was calm enough to read it , brought little comfort .\n",
      "\n",
      "16261: Her mother , still confident of their engagement , and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy , had only been roused by Elinor ' s application , to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both ; and this , with such tenderness towards her , such affection for Willoughby , and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other , that she wept with agony through the whole of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "16262: All her impatience to be at home again now returned ; her mother was dearer to her than ever ; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby , and she was wildly urgent to be gone .\n",
      "\n",
      "16263: Elinor , unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be in London or at Barton , offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother ' s wishes could be known ; and at length she obtained her sister ' s consent to wait for that knowledge .\n",
      "\n",
      "16264: Mrs . Jennings left them earlier than usual ; for she could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself ; and positively refusing Elinor ' s offered attendance , went out alone for the rest of the morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "16265: Elinor , with a very heavy heart , aware of the pain she was going to communicate , and perceiving , by Marianne ' s letter , how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it , then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed , and entreat her directions for the future ; while Marianne , who came into the drawing - room on Mrs . Jennings ' s going away , remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote , watching the advancement of her pen , grieving over her for the hardship of such a task , and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother .\n",
      "\n",
      "16272: said she , with vexation .\n",
      "\n",
      "16278: \" I met Mrs . Jennings in Bond Street ,\" said he , after the first salutation , \" and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing .\n",
      "\n",
      "16300: At seventeen she was lost to me for ever .\n",
      "\n",
      "16305: I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing -- but how blindly I relate !\n",
      "\n",
      "16309: I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father ' s point was gained .\n",
      "\n",
      "16314: She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned .\n",
      "\n",
      "16315: But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ?\n",
      "\n",
      "16324: I could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin .\n",
      "\n",
      "16332: That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was -- yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort .\n",
      "\n",
      "16337: Their fates , their fortunes , cannot be the same ; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind , or a happier marriage , she might have been all that you will live to see the other be .\n",
      "\n",
      "16346: I saw her there whenever I could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property ,) she visited me at Delaford .\n",
      "\n",
      "16348: It is now three years ago ( she had just reached her fourteenth year ,) that I removed her from school , to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in Dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation .\n",
      "\n",
      "16349: But last February , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared .\n",
      "\n",
      "16351: I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter -- better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill - judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all .\n",
      "\n",
      "16353: In short , I could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture .\n",
      "\n",
      "16367: Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes .\n",
      "\n",
      "16373: Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self - reproach , which must attend her through life .\n",
      "\n",
      "16382: \" I have been more pained ,\" said she , \" by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do .\n",
      "\n",
      "16383: Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier .\n",
      "\n",
      "16384: Have you ,\" she continued , after a short silence , \" ever seen Mr . Willoughby since you left him at Barton ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16391: Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this ; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it .\n",
      "\n",
      "16394: \" Is she still in town ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16395: \" No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16398: Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it , for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention , made neither objection nor remark , attempted no vindication of Willoughby , and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible .\n",
      "\n",
      "16399: But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind , though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it , in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called , in her speaking to him , even voluntarily speaking , with a kind of compassionate respect , and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before , she did not see her less wretched .\n",
      "\n",
      "16401: She felt the loss of Willoughby ' s character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart ; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams , the misery of that poor girl , and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself , preyed altogether so much on her spirits , that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor ; and , brooding over her sorrows in silence , gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them .\n",
      "\n",
      "16403: Long letters from her , quickly succeeding each other , arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought ; to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne , and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune .\n",
      "\n",
      "16406: Against the interest of her own individual comfort , Mrs . Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where , at that time , than at Barton , where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner , by constantly placing Willoughby before her , such as she had always seen him there .\n",
      "\n",
      "16408: A variety of occupations , of objects , and of company , which could not be procured at Barton , would be inevitable there , and might yet , she hoped , cheat Marianne , at times , into some interest beyond herself , and even into some amusement , much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her .\n",
      "\n",
      "16411: She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were ; a letter from her son - in - law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February , and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother .\n",
      "\n",
      "16412: Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother ' s opinion , and she submitted to it therefore without opposition , though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected , though she felt it to be entirely wrong , formed on mistaken grounds , and that by requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness , the personal sympathy of her mother , and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment ' s rest .\n",
      "\n",
      "16416: Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself , but that was impossible , and she was obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all .\n",
      "\n",
      "16430: \" She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "16431: She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16436: Every qualification is raised at times , by the circumstances of the moment , to more than its real value ; and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good - breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good - nature .\n",
      "\n",
      "16438: and by the means of this continual though gentle vent , was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion , but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter ; and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex , and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other , she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies , and therefore determined ( though rather against the opinion of Sir John ) that as Mrs . Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune , to leave her card with her as soon as she married .\n",
      "\n",
      "16441: His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations , was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him , and the gentleness of her voice whenever ( though it did not often happen ) she was obliged , or could oblige herself to speak to him .\n",
      "\n",
      "16442: THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good - will towards himself , and THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter ; but Mrs . Jennings , who knew nothing of all this , who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever , and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself , nor commission her to make it for him , began , at the end of two days , to think that , instead of Midsummer , they would not be married till Michaelmas , and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "16445: She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself , as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over , as she was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers , which she saw her eagerly examining every morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "16446: She received the news with resolute composure ; made no observation on it , and at first shed no tears ; but after a short time they would burst out , and for the rest of the day , she was in a state hardly less pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event .\n",
      "\n",
      "16447: The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married ; and Elinor now hoped , as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them , to prevail on her sister , who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell , to go out again by degrees as she had done before .\n",
      "\n",
      "16450: Their presence always gave her pain , and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her STILL in town .\n",
      "\n",
      "16451: \" I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here STILL ,\" said she repeatedly , with a strong emphasis on the word .\n",
      "\n",
      "16458: Elinor perfectly understood her , and was forced to use all her self - command to make it appear that she did NOT .\n",
      "\n",
      "16468: here comes your beau , Nancy ,' my cousin said t ' other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house .\n",
      "\n",
      "16475: Mrs . Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she certainly would NOT , and Miss Steele was made completely happy .\n",
      "\n",
      "16486: \" I am sorry she is not well --\" for Marianne had left the room on their arrival .\n",
      "\n",
      "16488: My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16490: but such old friends as Lucy and me !-- I think she might see US ; and I am sure we would not speak a word .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16494: Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper ; but she was saved the trouble of checking it , by Lucy ' s sharp reprimand , which now , as on many occasions , though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one sister , was of advantage in governing those of the other .\n",
      "\n",
      "16497: When they stopped at the door , Mrs . Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call ; and as she had no business at Gray ' s , it was resolved , that while her young friends transacted their ' s , she should pay her visit and return for them .\n",
      "\n",
      "16502: Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment , on this impertinent examination of their features , and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick - cases presented to his inspection , by remaining unconscious of it all ; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself , and be as ignorant of what was passing around her , in Mr . Gray ' s shop , as in her own bedroom .\n",
      "\n",
      "16515: I understand she is a woman of very good fortune .\n",
      "\n",
      "16529: He came with a pretence at an apology from their sister - in - law , for not coming too ; \" but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16530: Mrs . Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs . John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her .\n",
      "\n",
      "16533: The weather was remarkably fine , and she readily consented .\n",
      "\n",
      "16557: Recollecting himself , however , he added , \" That is , I mean to say -- your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you .\n",
      "\n",
      "16558: And her mother too , Mrs . Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16570: To give you another instance of her liberality :-- The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny ' s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds .\n",
      "\n",
      "16572: He paused for her assent and compassion ; and she forced herself to say , \" Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16598: \" She seems a most valuable woman indeed -- Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous .-- Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten .-- She must have a great deal to leave .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16599: \" Nothing at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16600: \" But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income .\n",
      "\n",
      "16601: Few people of common prudence will do THAT ; and whatever she saves , she will be able to dispose of .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16602: \" And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16604: Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard .\n",
      "\n",
      "16605: Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16606: \" But she raises none in those most concerned .\n",
      "\n",
      "16609: But , my dear Elinor , what is the matter with Marianne ?-- she looks very unwell , has lost her colour , and is grown quite thin .\n",
      "\n",
      "16610: Is she ill ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16611: \" She is not well , she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16617: I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her .\n",
      "\n",
      "16631: Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs . Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs . Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with .\n",
      "\n",
      "16633: CHAPTER 34 Mrs . John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband ' s judgment , that she waited the very next day both on Mrs . Jennings and her daughter ; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former , even the woman with whom her sisters were staying , by no means unworthy her notice ; and as for Lady Middleton , she found her one of the most charming women in the world !\n",
      "\n",
      "16636: The same manners , however , which recommended Mrs . John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs . Jennings , and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud - looking woman of uncordial address , who met her husband ' s sisters without any affection , and almost without having anything to say to them ; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street , she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence .\n",
      "\n",
      "16637: Elinor wanted very much to know , though she did not chuse to ask , whether Edward was then in town ; but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her , till able to tell her that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on , or till her husband ' s expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered ; because she believed them still so very much attached to each other , that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion .\n",
      "\n",
      "16643: Elinor was pleased that he had called ; and still more pleased that she had missed him .\n",
      "\n",
      "16647: The expectation of seeing HER , however , was enough to make her interested in the engagement ; for though she could now meet Edward ' s mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction , though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself , her desire of being in company with Mrs . Ferrars , her curiosity to know what she was like , was as lively as ever .\n",
      "\n",
      "16648: The interest with which she thus anticipated the party , was soon afterwards increased , more powerfully than pleasantly , by her hearing that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it .\n",
      "\n",
      "16649: So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton , so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her , that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant , and her sister not even genteel , she was as ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street ; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles , as soon as the Dashwoods ' invitation was known , that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place .\n",
      "\n",
      "16650: Their claims to the notice of Mrs . John Dashwood , as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother , might not have done much , however , towards procuring them seats at her table ; but as Lady Middleton ' s guests they must be welcome ; and Lucy , who had long wanted to be personally known to the family , to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties , and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them , had seldom been happier in her life , than she was on receiving Mrs . John Dashwood ' s card .\n",
      "\n",
      "16652: She began immediately to determine , that Edward who lived with his mother , must be asked as his mother was , to a party given by his sister ; and to see him for the first time , after all that passed , in the company of Lucy !-- she hardly knew how she could bear it !\n",
      "\n",
      "16654: They were relieved however , not by her own recollection , but by the good will of Lucy , who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday , and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme affection for herself , which he could not conceal when they were together .\n",
      "\n",
      "16659: -- Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton ' s mother , rather than her own , whom they were about to behold ; but instead of doing that , she assured her , and with great sincerity , that she did pity her -- to the utter amazement of Lucy , who , though really uncomfortable herself , hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor .\n",
      "\n",
      "16662: She was not a woman of many words ; for , unlike people in general , she proportioned them to the number of her ideas ; and of the few syllables that did escape her , not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood , whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events .\n",
      "\n",
      "16664: She could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person -- for Lucy was particularly distinguished -- whom of all others , had they known as much as she did , they would have been most anxious to mortify ; while she herself , who had comparatively no power to wound them , sat pointedly slighted by both .\n",
      "\n",
      "16665: But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied , she could not reflect on the mean - spirited folly from which it sprung , nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance , without thoroughly despising them all four .\n",
      "\n",
      "16675: Lucy , who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other , thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age , and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them ; and Miss Steele , with yet greater address gave it , as fast as she could , in favour of each .\n",
      "\n",
      "16676: Elinor , having once delivered her opinion on William ' s side , by which she offended Mrs . Ferrars and Fanny still more , did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion ; and Marianne , when called on for her ' s , offended them all , by declaring that she had no opinion to give , as she had never thought about it .\n",
      "\n",
      "16679: I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16683: Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough ,-- for , colouring a little , she immediately said , \" They are very pretty , ma ' am -- an ' t they ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16684: But then again , the dread of having been too civil , too encouraging herself , probably came over her , for she presently added , \" Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton ' s style of painting , Ma ' am ?-- She DOES paint most delightfully !-- How beautifully her last landscape is done !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16687: Marianne could not bear this .-- She was already greatly displeased with Mrs . Ferrars ; and such ill - timed praise of another , at Elinor ' s expense , though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by it , provoked her immediately to say with warmth , \" This is admiration of a very particular kind !-- what is Miss Morton to us ?-- who knows , or who cares , for her ?-- it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16688: And so saying , she took the screens out of her sister - in - law ' s hands , to admire them herself as they ought to be admired .\n",
      "\n",
      "16691: Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne ' s warmth than she had been by what produced it ; but Colonel Brandon ' s eyes , as they were fixed on Marianne , declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it , the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point .\n",
      "\n",
      "16693: The cold insolence of Mrs . Ferrars ' s general behaviour to her sister , seemed , to her , to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor , as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror ; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility , she moved after a moment , to her sister ' s chair , and putting one arm round her neck , and one cheek close to hers , said in a low , but eager , voice , \" Dear , dear Elinor , don ' t mind them .\n",
      "\n",
      "16695: She could say no more ; her spirits were quite overcome , and hiding her face on Elinor ' s shoulder , she burst into tears .\n",
      "\n",
      "16701: said her brother to Colonel Brandon , in a low voice , as soon as he could secure his attention ,-- \" She has not such good health as her sister ,-- she is very nervous ,-- she has not Elinor ' s constitution ;-- and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions .\n",
      "\n",
      "16703: CHAPTER 35 Elinor ' s curiosity to see Mrs . Ferrars was satisfied .-- She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable .-- She had seen enough of her pride , her meanness , and her determined prejudice against herself , to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement , and retarded the marriage , of Edward and herself , had he been otherwise free ;-- and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake , that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs . Ferrars ' s creation , preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice , or any solicitude for her good opinion .\n",
      "\n",
      "16704: Or at least , if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward ' s being fettered to Lucy , she determined , that had Lucy been more amiable , she OUGHT to have rejoiced .\n",
      "\n",
      "16705: She wondered that Lucy ' s spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs . Ferrars ;-- that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR , appear a compliment to herself -- or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her , because her real situation was unknown .\n",
      "\n",
      "16706: But that it was so , had not only been declared by Lucy ' s eyes at the time , but was declared over again the next morning more openly , for at her particular desire , Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone , to tell her how happy she was .\n",
      "\n",
      "16707: The chance proved a lucky one , for a message from Mrs . Palmer soon after she arrived , carried Mrs . Jennings away .\n",
      "\n",
      "16710: So exceeding affable as she was !-- You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her ;-- but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me .\n",
      "\n",
      "16715: Elinor wished to talk of something else , but Lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness ; and Elinor was obliged to go on .-- \" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement ,\" said she , \" nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you ;-- but as that was not the case \"-- \" I guessed you would say so \"-- replied Lucy quickly --\" but there was no reason in the world why Mrs . Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "16726: But it seemed to satisfy Lucy , for she directly replied , \" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward ' s love , it is the greatest comfort I have .-- Poor Edward !-- But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton ' s delighted with Mrs . Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs . Ferrars will visit now ;-- and Mrs . Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me .-- They are such charming women !-- I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you cannot speak too high .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16727: But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULD tell her sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "16730: If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way -- you know what I mean -- if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair .\n",
      "\n",
      "16732: For where she DOES dislike , I know it is most violent .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16740: But Elinor had more to do ; and so anxious was she , for his sake and her own , to do it well , that she forced herself , after a moment ' s recollection , to welcome him , with a look and manner that were almost easy , and almost open ; and another struggle , another effort still improved them .\n",
      "\n",
      "16741: She would not allow the presence of Lucy , nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself , to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him , and that she had very much regretted being from home , when he called before in Berkeley Street .\n",
      "\n",
      "16742: She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which , as a friend and almost a relation , were his due , by the observant eyes of Lucy , though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her .\n",
      "\n",
      "16745: Her exertions did not stop here ; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine , under pretence of fetching Marianne , to leave the others by themselves ; and she really did it , and THAT in the handsomest manner , for she loitered away several minutes on the landing - place , with the most high - minded fortitude , before she went to her sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "16750: she cried , \" this is a moment of great happiness !-- This would almost make amends for every thing ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16755: she replied with spirited earnestness , though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke , \" don ' t think of MY health .\n",
      "\n",
      "16766: \" I think , Elinor ,\" she presently added , \" we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton .\n",
      "\n",
      "16772: And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever , and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother , till they were more in private .\n",
      "\n",
      "16778: Elinor was very angry , but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting ; for she calmly replied , \" Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street .\n",
      "\n",
      "16787: And drawing him a little aside , she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer .\n",
      "\n",
      "16791: \" Could not she see that we wanted her gone !-- how teazing to Edward !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16797: She then left the room ; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more , for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy , she could give no information that would convince Marianne ; and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be , she was obliged to submit to it .\n",
      "\n",
      "16798: All that she could hope , was that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne ' s mistaken warmth , nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting -- and this she had every reason to expect .\n",
      "\n",
      "16801: This event , highly important to Mrs . Jennings ' s happiness , produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time , and influenced , in a like degree , the engagements of her young friends ; for as she wished to be as much as possible with Charlotte , she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed , and did not return till late in the evening ; and the Miss Dashwoods , at the particular request of the Middletons , spent the whole of every day , in every day in Conduit Street .\n",
      "\n",
      "16805: Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton ' s behaviour to Elinor and Marianne , she did not really like them at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "16806: Because they neither flattered herself nor her children , she could not believe them good - natured ; and because they were fond of reading , she fancied them satirical : perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical ; but THAT did not signify .\n",
      "\n",
      "16810: Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them , and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times , she feared they would despise her for offering .\n",
      "\n",
      "16812: Would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr . Willoughby , she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner , which their arrival occasioned .\n",
      "\n",
      "16813: But this conciliation was not granted ; for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor , and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne , no effect was produced , but a look of indifference from the former , or of disgust in the latter .\n",
      "\n",
      "16816: But so little were they , anymore than the others , inclined to oblige her , that if Sir John dined from home , she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject , than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "16817: All these jealousies and discontents , however , were so totally unsuspected by Mrs . Jennings , that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together ; and generally congratulated her young friends every night , on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long .\n",
      "\n",
      "16818: She joined them sometimes at Sir John ' s , sometimes at her own house ; but wherever it was , she always came in excellent spirits , full of delight and importance , attributing Charlotte ' s well doing to her own care , and ready to give so exact , so minute a detail of her situation , as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire .\n",
      "\n",
      "16819: One thing DID disturb her ; and of that she made her daily complaint .\n",
      "\n",
      "16820: Mr . Palmer maintained the common , but unfatherly opinion among his sex , of all infants being alike ; and though she could plainly perceive , at different times , the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides , there was no convincing his father of it ; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age ; nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "16824: In the present instance , this last - arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability , that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods , and understanding them to be Mr . Dashwood ' s sisters , she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street ; and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards , cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister , to a small musical party at her house .\n",
      "\n",
      "16828: Marianne had now been brought by degrees , so much into the habit of going out every day , that it was become a matter of indifference to her , whether she went or not : and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening ' s engagement , though without expecting the smallest amusement from any , and very often without knowing , till the last moment , where it was to take her .\n",
      "\n",
      "16829: To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent , as not to bestow half the consideration on it , during the whole of her toilet , which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being together , when it was finished .\n",
      "\n",
      "16830: Nothing escaped HER minute observation and general curiosity ; she saw every thing , and asked every thing ; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of Marianne ' s dress ; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself , and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted , how much her washing cost per week , and how much she had every year to spend upon herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "16831: The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies , moreover , was generally concluded with a compliment , which though meant as its douceur , was considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all ; for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown , the colour of her shoes , and the arrangement of her hair , she was almost sure of being told that upon \" her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16832: With such encouragement as this , was she dismissed on the present occasion , to her brother ' s carriage ; which they were ready to enter five minutes after it stopped at the door , a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister - in - law , who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance , and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman .\n",
      "\n",
      "16835: As Elinor was neither musical , nor affecting to be so , she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte , whenever it suited her , and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp , and violoncello , would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "16836: In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young men , the very he , who had given them a lecture on toothpick - cases at Gray ' s .\n",
      "\n",
      "16838: He addressed her with easy civility , and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done , that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy .\n",
      "\n",
      "16841: But while she wondered at the difference of the two young men , she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one , put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other .\n",
      "\n",
      "16843: \" Upon my soul ,\" he added , \" I believe it is nothing more ; and so I often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it .\n",
      "\n",
      "16849: Elinor would not oppose his opinion , because , whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage of a public school , she could not think of Edward ' s abode in Mr . Pratt ' s family , with any satisfaction .\n",
      "\n",
      "16864: said she ; ' my dear Ferrars , do tell me how it is to be managed .\n",
      "\n",
      "16871: Elinor agreed to it all , for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition .\n",
      "\n",
      "16876: \" I do not see how it can be done ,\" said she , \" without affronting Lady Middleton , for they spend every day with her ; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it .\n",
      "\n",
      "16898: Mrs . Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life , as she was with them ; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant ; called Lucy by her Christian name ; and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them .\n",
      "\n",
      "16900: CHAPTER 37 Mrs . Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight , that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her ; and , contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day , returned from that period to her own home , and her own habits , in which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share .\n",
      "\n",
      "16911: But Charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so Mr . Donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , be said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then Charlotte was easy .\n",
      "\n",
      "16921: Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs . Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter ;-- till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well - meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out .\n",
      "\n",
      "16923: thinks she to herself , ' they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ;' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet - work , little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord ' s daughter or other , I forget who .\n",
      "\n",
      "16929: And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit .\n",
      "\n",
      "16930: Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do .\n",
      "\n",
      "16932: THEN she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr . Donavan , and Mr . Donavan found the house in all this uproar .\n",
      "\n",
      "16933: The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad .\n",
      "\n",
      "16940: He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs . Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care .\n",
      "\n",
      "16943: There is no reason on earth why Mr . Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs . Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs . Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a - year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight .\n",
      "\n",
      "16946: Here Mrs . Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce .\n",
      "\n",
      "16947: Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs . Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it .\n",
      "\n",
      "16948: She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was ; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last , than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy .\n",
      "\n",
      "16949: What Mrs . Ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "16950: For HIM she felt much compassion ;-- for Lucy very little -- and it cost her some pains to procure that little ;-- for the rest of the party none at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "16952: No time was to be lost in undeceiving her , in making her acquainted with the real truth , and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others , without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister , or any resentment against Edward .\n",
      "\n",
      "16953: Elinor ' s office was a painful one .-- She was going to remove what she really believed to be her sister ' s chief consolation ,-- to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion ,- and to make Marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to HER fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again .\n",
      "\n",
      "16955: She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self - command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward ' s engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne .\n",
      "\n",
      "16959: Edward seemed a second Willoughby ; and acknowledging as Elinor did , that she HAD loved him most sincerely , could she feel less than herself !\n",
      "\n",
      "16960: As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her .\n",
      "\n",
      "16966: When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told me in confidence of her engagement .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16968: After a pause of wonder , she exclaimed -- \" Four months !-- Have you known of this four months ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16992: Elinor ,\" she cried , \" you have made me hate myself for ever .-- How barbarous have I been to you !-- you , who have been my only comfort , who have borne with me in all my misery , who have seemed to be only suffering for me !-- Is this my gratitude ?-- Is this the only return I can make you ?-- Because your merit cries out upon myself , I have been trying to do it away .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "16994: In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness ;-- to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her ;-- and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality .-- These were great concessions ;-- but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make .\n",
      "\n",
      "17003: she was in hysterics all yesterday .\n",
      "\n",
      "17007: She says she never shall think well of anybody again ; and one cannot wonder at it , after being so deceived !-- meeting with such ingratitude , where so much kindness had been shewn , so much confidence had been placed !\n",
      "\n",
      "17008: It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well - behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter .\n",
      "\n",
      "17013: While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him , was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person !-- such a suspicion could never have entered her head !\n",
      "\n",
      "17014: If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere , it could not be in THAT quarter .\n",
      "\n",
      "17015: ' THERE , to be sure ,' said she , ' I might have thought myself safe .'\n",
      "\n",
      "17017: We consulted together , however , as to what should be done , and at last she determined to send for Edward .\n",
      "\n",
      "17023: His mother explained to him her liberal designs , in case of his marrying Miss Morton ; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate , which , clear of land - tax , brings in a good thousand a - year ; offered even , when matters grew desperate , to make it twelve hundred ; and in opposition to this , if he still persisted in this low connection , represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match .\n",
      "\n",
      "17024: His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all ; she would never see him again ; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance , that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support , she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17029: Marianne was going to retort , but she remembered her promises , and forbore .\n",
      "\n",
      "17059: Elinor ' s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward , though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "17078: Elinor avoided it upon principle , as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts , by the too warm , too positive assurances of Marianne , that belief of Edward ' s continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away ; and Marianne ' s courage soon failed her , in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever , by the comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor ' s conduct and her own .\n",
      "\n",
      "17079: She felt all the force of that comparison ; but not as her sister had hoped , to urge her to exertion now ; she felt it with all the pain of continual self - reproach , regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before ; but it brought only the torture of penitence , without the hope of amendment .\n",
      "\n",
      "17080: Her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible , and therefore it only dispirited her more .\n",
      "\n",
      "17082: But though so much of the matter was known to them already , that Mrs . Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther , without seeking after more , she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could ; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual , had prevented her going to them within that time .\n",
      "\n",
      "17085: An intimate acquaintance of Mrs . Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens , and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them , and engaging all Mrs . Jennings ' s conversation , she was herself left to quiet reflection .\n",
      "\n",
      "17087: But at last she found herself with some surprise , accosted by Miss Steele , who , though looking rather shy , expressed great satisfaction in meeting them , and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs . Jennings , left her own party for a short time , to join their ' s .\n",
      "\n",
      "17092: It was lucky , however , for Mrs . Jennings ' s curiosity and Elinor ' s too , that she would tell any thing WITHOUT being asked ; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt .\n",
      "\n",
      "17095: Is she angry ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17099: \" I cannot suppose it possible that she should .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17104: She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet , nor do any thing else for me again , so long as she lived ; but now she is quite come to , and we are as good friends as ever .\n",
      "\n",
      "17105: Look , she made me this bow to my hat , and put in the feather last night .\n",
      "\n",
      "17122: And after thinking it all over and over again , he said , it seemed to him as if , now he had no fortune , and no nothing at all , it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement , because it must be for her loss , for he had nothing but two thousand pounds , and no hope of any thing else ; and if he was to go into orders , as he had some thoughts , he could get nothing but a curacy , and how was they to live upon that ?-- He could not bear to think of her doing no better , and so he begged , if she had the least mind for it , to put an end to the matter directly , and leave him shift for himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "17126: But , to be sure , Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking ; so she told him directly ( with a great deal about sweet and love , you know , and all that -- Oh , la !\n",
      "\n",
      "17127: one can ' t repeat such kind of things you know )-- she told him directly , she had not the least mind in the world to be off , for she could live with him upon a trifle , and how little so ever he might have , she should be very glad to have it all , you know , or something of the kind .\n",
      "\n",
      "17129: And just then I could not hear any more , for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs . Richardson was come in her coach , and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens ; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them , to ask Lucy if she would like to go , but she did not care to leave Edward ; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17144: And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me ; for a year or two back , when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together , she never made any bones of hiding in a closet , or behind a chimney - board , on purpose to hear what we said .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17146: \" Edward talks of going to Oxford soon ,\" said she ; \" but now he is lodging at No .\n",
      "\n",
      "17148: What an ill - natured woman his mother is , an ' t she ?\n",
      "\n",
      "17151: And for my part , I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before ; but , however , nothing was said about them , and I took care to keep mine out of sight .\n",
      "\n",
      "17154: ( giggling as she spoke ) I ' d lay my life I know what my cousins will say , when they hear of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "17167: I have not time to speak to Mrs . Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs . Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes .\n",
      "\n",
      "17173: Such was her parting concern ; for after this , she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs . Jennings , before her company was claimed by Mrs . Richardson ; and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time , though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind .\n",
      "\n",
      "17174: Edward ' s marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined on , and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain , as she had concluded it would be ;-- every thing depended , exactly after her expectation , on his getting that preferment , of which , at present , there seemed not the smallest chance .\n",
      "\n",
      "17175: As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs . Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known .\n",
      "\n",
      "17186: I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs . Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother ' s anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs . Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr . Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us .-- Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs . Jennings won ' t think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ' twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her .-- My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne , \" I am , & c .\" As soon as Elinor had finished it , she performed what she concluded to be its writer ' s real design , by placing it in the hands of Mrs . Jennings , who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise .\n",
      "\n",
      "17187: \" Very well indeed !-- how prettily she writes !-- aye , that was quite proper to let him be off if he would .\n",
      "\n",
      "17193: How attentive she is , to think of every body !-- Thank you , my dear , for shewing it me .\n",
      "\n",
      "17197: Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge .\n",
      "\n",
      "17201: When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious .\n",
      "\n",
      "17203: -- she cried , with great agitation .\n",
      "\n",
      "17206: Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings ;-- she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others ;-- represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay .\n",
      "\n",
      "17208: As Marianne ' s affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started .\n",
      "\n",
      "17209: Mrs . Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland .\n",
      "\n",
      "17214: Perhaps Mrs . Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it ;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor ' s moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes .\n",
      "\n",
      "17215: The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment .-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne ' s turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel ' s inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house .\n",
      "\n",
      "17218: What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think THAT any material objection ;-- and Mrs . Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest .\n",
      "\n",
      "17220: Astonished and shocked at so unlover - like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , \" Lord !\n",
      "\n",
      "17224: This delay on the Colonel ' s side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , Mrs . Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say , and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said , \" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17228: \" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty ,\"-- he replied , with great feeling ,--\" of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible .-- Mrs . Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to .\n",
      "\n",
      "17236: The preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward , was already provided to enable him to marry ;-- and SHE , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it !-- Her emotion was such as Mrs . Jennings had attributed to a very different cause ;-- but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed .\n",
      "\n",
      "17237: She thanked him for it with all her heart , spoke of Edward ' s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve ; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure , if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another .\n",
      "\n",
      "17238: But at the same time , she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "17239: It was an office in short , from which , unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER , she would have been very glad to be spared herself ;-- but Colonel Brandon , on motives of equal delicacy , declining it likewise , still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means , that she would not on any account make farther opposition .\n",
      "\n",
      "17240: Edward , she believed , was still in town , and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele .\n",
      "\n",
      "17243: \" The smallness of the house ,\" said she , \" I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17284: Why Mr . Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry , she could not immediately comprehend .\n",
      "\n",
      "17285: A few moments ' reflection , however , produced a very happy idea , and she exclaimed ;-- \" Oh , ho !-- I understand you .\n",
      "\n",
      "17291: Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs . Jennings ' s speech , neither did she think it worth inquiring into ; and therefore only replied to its conclusion .\n",
      "\n",
      "17299: And away she went ; but returning again in a moment , \" I have just been thinking of Betty ' s sister , my dear .\n",
      "\n",
      "17301: But whether she would do for a lady ' s maid , I am sure I can ' t tell .\n",
      "\n",
      "17304: \" Certainly , ma ' am ,\" replied Elinor , not hearing much of what she said , and more anxious to be alone , than to be mistress of the subject .\n",
      "\n",
      "17305: How she should begin -- how she should express herself in her note to Edward , was now all her concern .\n",
      "\n",
      "17306: The particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world ; but she equally feared to say too much or too little , and sat deliberating over her paper , with the pen in her hand , till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "17307: He had met Mrs . Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage , as he came to leave his farewell card ; and she , after apologising for not returning herself , had obliged him to enter , by saying that Miss Dashwood was above , and wanted to speak with him on very particular business .\n",
      "\n",
      "17310: She had not seen him before since his engagement became public , and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it ; which , with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of , and what she had to tell him , made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes .\n",
      "\n",
      "17314: \" You would not have gone , however ,\" said Elinor , recovering herself , and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible , \" without receiving our good wishes , even if we had not been able to give them in person .\n",
      "\n",
      "17315: Mrs . Jennings was quite right in what she said .\n",
      "\n",
      "17317: I am charged with a most agreeable office ( breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke .)\n",
      "\n",
      "17331: Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action , but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward , that she acknowledged it with hesitation ; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it .\n",
      "\n",
      "17336: Edward made no answer ; but when she had turned away her head , gave her a look so serious , so earnest , so uncheerful , as seemed to say , that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion - house much greater .\n",
      "\n",
      "17342: And with this pleasing anticipation , she sat down to reconsider the past , recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward ; and , of course , to reflect on her own with discontent .\n",
      "\n",
      "17343: When Mrs . Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared .\n",
      "\n",
      "17344: \" Well , my dear ,\" she cried , \" I sent you up to the young man .\n",
      "\n",
      "17359: \" Aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one ,\" said she , after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over , \" and very likely MAY be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as I thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground - floor , and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds !-- and to you too , that had been used to live in Barton cottage !-- It seems quite ridiculous .\n",
      "\n",
      "17365: CHAPTER 41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett ' s Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs . Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life .\n",
      "\n",
      "17366: Her own happiness , and her own spirits , were at least very certain ; and she joined Mrs . Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas .\n",
      "\n",
      "17367: So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood ' s part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued .\n",
      "\n",
      "17368: As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and scarcely resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry .\n",
      "\n",
      "17370: Marianne , not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself , was very urgent to prevent her sister ' s going at all ; and Mrs . Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor ' s service , so very much disliked Mrs . John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward ' s part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again .\n",
      "\n",
      "17375: \" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose ,\" said he :--\" I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU .-- Very far from it , indeed .\n",
      "\n",
      "17377: -- Elinor made what excuse she could for her .\n",
      "\n",
      "17387: Elinor contradicted it , however , very positively ; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward , and , therefore , must understand the terms on which it was given , obliged him to submit to her authority .\n",
      "\n",
      "17389: -- he cried , after hearing what she said --\" what could be the Colonel ' s motive ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17392: \" Well , well ; whatever Colonel Brandon may be , Edward is a very lucky man .-- You will not mention the matter to Fanny , however , for though I have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well ,-- she will not like to hear it much talked of .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17393: Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished .\n",
      "\n",
      "17394: \" Mrs . Ferrars ,\" added he , lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject , \" knows nothing about it at present , and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be .-- When the marriage takes place , I fear she must hear of it all .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17395: \" But why should such precaution be used ?-- Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs . Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon ,-- for THAT must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all ?-- She has done with her son , she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise .\n",
      "\n",
      "17396: Surely , after doing so , she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account -- she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him .-- She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child , and yet retain the anxiety of a parent !\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17399: When Edward ' s unhappy match takes place , depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him ; and , therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event , must be concealed from her as much as possible .\n",
      "\n",
      "17408: \" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17414: ' It would have been beyond comparison ,' she said , ' the least evil of the two , and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse .'\n",
      "\n",
      "17420: Elinor had heard enough , if not to gratify her vanity , and raise her self - importance , to agitate her nerves and fill her mind ;-- and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself , and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother , by the entrance of Mr . Robert Ferrars .\n",
      "\n",
      "17423: Elinor repeated the particulars of it , as she had given them to John ; and their effect on Robert , though very different , was not less striking than it had been on HIM .\n",
      "\n",
      "17426: Elinor , while she waited in silence and immovable gravity , the conclusion of such folly , could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited .\n",
      "\n",
      "17438: \" Yes ; once , while she was staying in this house , I happened to drop in for ten minutes ; and I saw quite enough of her .\n",
      "\n",
      "17450: But though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family , Elinor could see its influence on her mind , in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered , and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "17451: She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them ;-- an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful .\n",
      "\n",
      "17453: It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to Delaford ;-- a place , in which , of all others , she would now least chuse to visit , or wish to reside ; for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother and Mrs . Jennings , but even Lucy , when they parted , gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there .\n",
      "\n",
      "17456: Marianne , few as had been her hours of comfort in London , and eager as she had long been to quit it , could not , when it came to the point , bid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those hopes , and that confidence , in Willoughby , which were now extinguished for ever , without great pain .\n",
      "\n",
      "17457: Nor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained , busy in new engagements , and new schemes , in which SHE could have no share , without shedding many tears .\n",
      "\n",
      "17459: She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on , she left no creature behind , from whom it would give her a moment ' s regret to be divided for ever , she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of Lucy ' s friendship , she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage , and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring Marianne ' s peace of mind , and confirming her own .\n",
      "\n",
      "17464: Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton , and not thirty from Combe Magna ; and before she had been five minutes within its walls , while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child to the housekeeper , she quitted it again , stealing away through the winding shrubberies , now just beginning to be in beauty , to gain a distant eminence ; where , from its Grecian temple , her eye , wandering over a wide tract of country to the south - east , could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon , and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen .\n",
      "\n",
      "17465: In such moments of precious , invaluable misery , she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland ; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house , feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty , of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude , she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the Palmers , in the indulgence of such solitary rambles .\n",
      "\n",
      "17466: She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house , on an excursion through its more immediate premises ; and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away , in lounging round the kitchen garden , examining the bloom upon its walls , and listening to the gardener ' s lamentations upon blights , in dawdling through the green - house , where the loss of her favourite plants , unwarily exposed , and nipped by the lingering frost , raised the laughter of Charlotte ,-- and in visiting her poultry - yard , where , in the disappointed hopes of her dairy - maid , by hens forsaking their nests , or being stolen by a fox , or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood , she found fresh sources of merriment .\n",
      "\n",
      "17468: With great surprise therefore , did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner .\n",
      "\n",
      "17476: Elinor had seen so little of Mr . Palmer , and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her sister and herself , that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family .\n",
      "\n",
      "17477: She found him , however , perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors , and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother ; she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion , and only prevented from being so always , by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general , as he must feel himself to be to Mrs . Jennings and Charlotte .\n",
      "\n",
      "17480: She liked him , however , upon the whole , much better than she had expected , and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more ;-- not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism , his selfishness , and his conceit , to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward ' s generous temper , simple taste , and diffident feelings .\n",
      "\n",
      "17481: Of Edward , or at least of some of his concerns , she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon , who had been into Dorsetshire lately ; and who , treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr . Ferrars , and the kind of confidant of himself , talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford , described its deficiencies , and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them .-- His behaviour to her in this , as well as in every other particular , his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days , his readiness to converse with her , and his deference for her opinion , might very well justify Mrs . Jennings ' s persuasion of his attachment , and would have been enough , perhaps , had not Elinor still , as from the first , believed Marianne his real favourite , to make her suspect it herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "17482: But as it was , such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head , except by Mrs . Jennings ' s suggestion ; and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two ;-- she watched his eyes , while Mrs . Jennings thought only of his behaviour ;-- and while his looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne ' s feeling , in her head and throat , the beginning of a heavy cold , because unexpressed by words , entirely escaped the latter lady ' s observation ;-- SHE could discover in them the quick feelings , and needless alarm of a lover .\n",
      "\n",
      "17485: Though heavy and feverish , with a pain in her limbs , and a cough , and a sore throat , a good night ' s rest was to cure her entirely ; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her , when she went to bed , to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies .\n",
      "\n",
      "17486: CHAPTER 43 Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time ; to every inquiry replied that she was better , and tried to prove herself so , by engaging in her accustomary employments .\n",
      "\n",
      "17487: But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister ' s composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne ' s inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm .\n",
      "\n",
      "17491: Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr . Harris ' s arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr . Palmer ' s , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her .\n",
      "\n",
      "17492: Mrs . Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use .\n",
      "\n",
      "17494: The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one .\n",
      "\n",
      "17495: The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse .\n",
      "\n",
      "17496: Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr . Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise .-- Here , however , the kindness of Mrs . Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister ' s account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c . she urged him so strongly to remain , that he , who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance , could not long even affect to demur ; especially as Mrs . Jennings ' s entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr . Palmer , who seemed to feel a relief to himself , in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence .\n",
      "\n",
      "17498: She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away , in about seven days from the time of their arrival .\n",
      "\n",
      "17499: It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs . Palmer ; and as it gave her likewise no concern , she never mentioned her name .\n",
      "\n",
      "17506: Elinor , confirmed in every pleasant hope , was all cheerfulness ; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother , she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend ' s , in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland ; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel .\n",
      "\n",
      "17508: Her sister , however , still sanguine , was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made ; and carefully administering the cordials prescribed , saw her , with satisfaction , sink at last into a slumber , from which she expected the most beneficial effects .\n",
      "\n",
      "17509: Her sleep , though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it , lasted a considerable time ; and anxious to observe the result of it herself , she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "17511: The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed ; and her sister , who watched , with unremitting attention her continual change of posture , and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips , was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber , when Marianne , suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house , started hastily up , and , with feverish wildness , cried out ,-- \" Is mama coming ?--\" \" Not yet ,\" cried the other , concealing her terror , and assisting Marianne to lie down again , \" but she will be here , I hope , before it is long .\n",
      "\n",
      "17513: \" But she must not go round by London ,\" cried Marianne , in the same hurried manner .\n",
      "\n",
      "17514: \" I shall never see her , if she goes by London .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17515: Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself , and , while attempting to soothe her , eagerly felt her pulse .\n",
      "\n",
      "17518: To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the latter , was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance ; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister , she hastened down to the drawing - room , where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present .\n",
      "\n",
      "17523: She thanked him with brief , though fervent gratitude , and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr . Harris , and an order for post - horses directly , she wrote a few lines to her mother .\n",
      "\n",
      "17525: HE , meanwhile , whatever he might feel , acted with all the firmness of a collected mind , made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch , and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return .\n",
      "\n",
      "17528: It was then about twelve o ' clock , and she returned to her sister ' s apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary , and to watch by her the rest of the night .\n",
      "\n",
      "17531: Her apprehensions once raised , paid by their excess for all her former security ; and the servant who sat up with her , for she would not allow Mrs . Jennings to be called , only tortured her more , by hints of what her mistress had always thought .\n",
      "\n",
      "17532: Marianne ' s ideas were still , at intervals , fixed incoherently on her mother , and whenever she mentioned her name , it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor , who , reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness , and wretched for some immediate relief , fancied that all relief might soon be in vain , that every thing had been delayed too long , and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child , or to see her rational .\n",
      "\n",
      "17540: On Mrs . Jennings ' s compassion she had other claims .\n",
      "\n",
      "17541: She had been for three months her companion , was still under her care , and she was known to have been greatly injured , and long unhappy .\n",
      "\n",
      "17547: She was calm , except when she thought of her mother ; but she was almost hopeless ; and in this state she continued till noon , scarcely stirring from her sister ' s bed , her thoughts wandering from one image of grief , one suffering friend to another , and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs . Jennings , who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne ' s disappointment had brought on .\n",
      "\n",
      "17549: About noon , however , she began -- but with a caution -- a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent , even to her friend -- to fancy , to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister ' s pulse ;-- she waited , watched , and examined it again and again ;-- and at last , with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness , than all her foregoing distress , ventured to communicate her hopes .\n",
      "\n",
      "17552: Hope had already entered ; and feeling all its anxious flutter , she bent over her sister to watch -- she hardly knew for what .\n",
      "\n",
      "17564: The possibility of a relapse would of course , in some moments , occur to remind her of what anxiety was -- but when she saw , on her frequent and minute examination , that every symptom of recovery continued , and saw Marianne at six o ' clock sink into a quiet , steady , and to all appearance comfortable , sleep , she silenced every doubt .\n",
      "\n",
      "17566: At ten o ' clock , she trusted , or at least not much later her mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be travelling towards them .\n",
      "\n",
      "17568: At seven o ' clock , leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep , she joined Mrs . Jennings in the drawing - room to tea .\n",
      "\n",
      "17569: Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears , and of dinner by their sudden reverse , from eating much ;-- and the present refreshment , therefore , with such feelings of content as she brought to it , was particularly welcome .\n",
      "\n",
      "17570: Mrs . Jennings would have persuaded her , at its conclusion , to take some rest before her mother ' s arrival , and allow HER to take her place by Marianne ; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue , no capability of sleep at that moment about her , and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant .\n",
      "\n",
      "17576: Had it been ten , Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house ; and so strong was the persuasion that she DID , in spite of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come , that she moved into the adjoining dressing - closet and opened a window shutter , to be satisfied of the truth .\n",
      "\n",
      "17579: By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn by four horses ; and this , while it told the excess of her poor mother ' s alarm , gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity .\n",
      "\n",
      "17582: All that remained to be done was to be speedy ; and , therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs . Jennings ' s maid with her sister , she hurried down stairs .\n",
      "\n",
      "17583: The bustle in the vestibule , as she passed along an inner lobby , assured her that they were already in the house .\n",
      "\n",
      "17584: She rushed to the drawing - room ,-- she entered it ,-- and saw only Willoughby .\n",
      "\n",
      "17586: \" No , sir ,\" she replied with firmness , \" I shall NOT stay .\n",
      "\n",
      "17594: She hesitated ; she knew not what to do .\n",
      "\n",
      "17596: But she had promised to hear him , and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged .\n",
      "\n",
      "17597: After a moment ' s recollection , therefore , concluding that prudence required dispatch , and that her acquiescence would best promote it , she walked silently towards the table , and sat down .\n",
      "\n",
      "17607: \" For God ' s sake tell me , is she out of danger , or is she not ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17608: \" We hope she is .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17612: She began to think that he must be in liquor ;-- the strangeness of such a visit , and of such manners , seemed no otherwise intelligible ; and with this impression she immediately rose , saying , \" Mr . Willoughby , I advise you at present to return to Combe -- I am not at leisure to remain with you longer .-- Whatever your business may be with me , will it be better recollected and explained to - morrow .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17617: The steadiness of his manner , and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke , convincing Elinor , that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland , he was not brought there by intoxication , she said , after a moment ' s recollection , \" Mr . Willoughby , you OUGHT to feel , and I certainly DO -- that after what has passed -- your coming here in this manner , and forcing yourself upon my notice , requires a very particular excuse .-- What is it , that you mean by it ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17622: \" If that is all , you may be satisfied already ,-- for Marianne DOES -- she has LONG forgiven you .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17623: \" Has she ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17624: -- he cried , in the same eager tone .-- \" Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it .\n",
      "\n",
      "17625: But she shall forgive me again , and on more reasonable grounds .-- NOW will you listen to me ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17653: I do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge -- that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because I was a libertine , SHE must be a saint .\n",
      "\n",
      "17662: You must have known , that while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes , always gay , always happy , she was reduced to the extremest indigence .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17673: she offered to forgive the past , if I would marry Eliza .\n",
      "\n",
      "17708: \" Ah !-- no ,-- have you forgot what passed in town ?-- That infamous letter -- Did she shew it you ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17710: \" When the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for I was in town the whole time ,) what I felt is -- in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one -- perhaps too simple to raise any emotion -- my feelings were very , very painful .-- Every line , every word was -- in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid -- a dagger to my heart .\n",
      "\n",
      "17711: To know that Marianne was in town was -- in the same language -- a thunderbolt .-- Thunderbolts and daggers !-- what a reproof would she have given me !-- her taste , her opinions -- I believe they are better known to me than my own ,-- and I am sure they are dearer .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17712: Elinor ' s heart , which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation , was now softened again ;-- yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last .\n",
      "\n",
      "17716: \" Marianne ' s note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse .\n",
      "\n",
      "17717: I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ' I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married .'\n",
      "\n",
      "17719: I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that I was using her infamously .\n",
      "\n",
      "17738: Well , at last , as I need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure I cut !-- what an evening of agony it was !-- Marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me Willoughby in such a tone !-- Oh , God !-- holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face !-- and Sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was -- Well , it does not signify ; it is over now .-- Such an evening !-- I ran away from you all as soon as I could ; but not before I had seen Marianne ' s sweet face as white as death .-- THAT was the last , last look I ever had of her ;-- the last manner in which she appeared to me .\n",
      "\n",
      "17739: It was a horrid sight !-- yet when I thought of her to - day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world .\n",
      "\n",
      "17749: You saw what she said .\n",
      "\n",
      "17753: Affecting that air of playfulness , therefore , which is delightful in a woman one loves , she opened the letter directly , and read its contents .\n",
      "\n",
      "17772: She must be attached to you , or she would not have married you .\n",
      "\n",
      "17779: \" Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what I have been telling you ?-- Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours .\n",
      "\n",
      "17780: You tell me that she has forgiven me already .\n",
      "\n",
      "17782: Tell her of my misery and my penitence -- tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17798: From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said -- \" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17807: Elinor assured him that she did ;-- that she forgave , pitied , wished him well -- was even interested in his happiness -- and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it .\n",
      "\n",
      "17819: She can never be more lost to you than she is now .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17820: \" But she will be gained by some one else .\n",
      "\n",
      "17825: Willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men , Willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion , as she soon acknowledged within herself -- to his wishes than to his merits .\n",
      "\n",
      "17827: But she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less .\n",
      "\n",
      "17828: When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes .\n",
      "\n",
      "17831: Short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after Willoughby ' s leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage .-- Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment ' s horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it .\n",
      "\n",
      "17832: Mrs . Dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne ' s being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for Elinor ; but SHE , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief ;-- and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears .\n",
      "\n",
      "17835: As soon as Mrs . Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger .\n",
      "\n",
      "17836: Elinor ' s delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep ;-- but Mrs . Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her .\n",
      "\n",
      "17839: Willoughby , \" poor Willoughby ,\" as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before .\n",
      "\n",
      "17841: She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower .\n",
      "\n",
      "17843: The shock of Colonel Brandon ' s errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs . Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection .\n",
      "\n",
      "17844: Marianne continued to mend every day , and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs . Dashwood ' s looks and spirits proved her to be , as she repeatedly declared herself , one of the happiest women in the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "17847: Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her ;-- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor .\n",
      "\n",
      "17857: Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given ;-- but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off with a smile .\n",
      "\n",
      "17875: Yet after a time I DID say , for at first I was quite overcome -- that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power .\n",
      "\n",
      "17885: I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17887: \" At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me ,\" added Mrs . Dashwood , \" even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability ,-- for I hear it is a large village ,-- indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17892: When there , at her own particular request , for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother , Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her .\n",
      "\n",
      "17893: His emotion on entering the room , in seeing her altered looks , and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him , was such , as , in Elinor ' s conjecture , must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne , or the consciousness of its being known to others ; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister , the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind , brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged , and now strengthened by the hollow eye , the sickly skin , the posture of reclining weakness , and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation .\n",
      "\n",
      "17894: Mrs . Dashwood , not less watchful of what passed than her daughter , but with a mind very differently influenced , and therefore watching to very different effect , saw nothing in the Colonel ' s behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self - evident sensations , while in the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned .\n",
      "\n",
      "17898: The day of separation and departure arrived ; and Marianne , after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs . Jennings , one so earnestly grateful , so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention , and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend , was carefully assisted by him into the carriage , of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half .\n",
      "\n",
      "17903: She , who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering , oppressed by anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of , nor fortitude to conceal , now saw with a joy , which no other could equally share , an apparent composure of mind , which , in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection , must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness .\n",
      "\n",
      "17904: As they approached Barton , indeed , and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar , some painful recollection , she grew silent and thoughtful , and turning away her face from their notice , sat earnestly gazing through the window .\n",
      "\n",
      "17905: But here , Elinor could neither wonder nor blame ; and when she saw , as she assisted Marianne from the carriage , that she had been crying , she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity , and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise .\n",
      "\n",
      "17906: In the whole of her subsequent manner , she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion ; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting - room , than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness , as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be connected .-- She said little , but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness , and though a sigh sometimes escaped her , it never passed away without the atonement of a smile .\n",
      "\n",
      "17907: After dinner she would try her piano - forte .\n",
      "\n",
      "17908: She went to it ; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera , procured for her by Willoughby , containing some of their favourite duets , and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand - writing .-- That would not do .-- She shook her head , put the music aside , and after running over the keys for a minute , complained of feebleness in her fingers , and closed the instrument again ; declaring however with firmness as she did so , that she should in future practice much .\n",
      "\n",
      "17910: On the contrary , with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest , she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit , anticipating the pleasure of Margaret ' s return , and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored , of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society , as the only happiness worth a wish .\n",
      "\n",
      "17911: \" When the weather is settled , and I have recovered my strength ,\" said she , \" we will take long walks together every day .\n",
      "\n",
      "17921: Her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled , and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of Marianne , and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity .\n",
      "\n",
      "17922: Willing therefore to delay the evil hour , she resolved to wait till her sister ' s health were more secure , before she appointed it .\n",
      "\n",
      "17925: But at last a soft , genial morning appeared ; such as might tempt the daughter ' s wishes and the mother ' s confidence ; and Marianne , leaning on Elinor ' s arm , was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue , in the lane before the house .\n",
      "\n",
      "17927: Her voice sunk with the word , but presently reviving she added , \" I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot !-- shall we ever talk on that subject , Elinor ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17932: Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered , \" If you could be assured of that , you think you should be easy .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17973: She managed the recital , as she hoped , with address ; prepared her anxious listener with caution ; related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology ; did justice to his repentance , and softened only his protestations of present regard .\n",
      "\n",
      "17975: A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart , but she dared not urge one .\n",
      "\n",
      "17979: Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought ; and with a mind anxiously pre - arranging its result , and a resolution of reviving the subject again , should Marianne fail to do it , she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting injunction .\n",
      "\n",
      "17981: She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt ;-- she was sorry for him ;-- she wished him happy .\n",
      "\n",
      "17985: Had Mrs . Dashwood , like her daughter , heard Willoughby ' s story from himself -- had she witnessed his distress , and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner , it is probable that her compassion would have been greater .\n",
      "\n",
      "17987: Reflection had given calmness to her judgment , and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby ' s deserts ;-- she wished , therefore , to declare only the simple truth , and lay open such facts as were really due to his character , without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray .\n",
      "\n",
      "17988: In the evening , when they were all three together , Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again ;-- but that it was not without an effort , the restless , unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting -- her rising colour , as she spoke ,-- and her unsteady voice , plainly shewed .\n",
      "\n",
      "17989: \" I wish to assure you both ,\" said she , \" that I see every thing -- as you can desire me to do .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "17992: -- For some moments her voice was lost ; but recovering herself , she added , and with greater calmness than before --\" I am now perfectly satisfied , I wish for no change .\n",
      "\n",
      "18003: Marianne ' s lips quivered , and she repeated the word \" Selfish ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "18019: Marianne would not let her proceed ;-- and Elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister ' s spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued , \" One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby ' s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams .\n",
      "\n",
      "18023: Elinor , according to her expectation , saw on the two or three following days , that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done ; but while her resolution was unsubdued , and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy , her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health .\n",
      "\n",
      "18031: Mrs . Dashwood , whose eyes , as she answered the servant ' s inquiry , had intuitively taken the same direction , was shocked to perceive by Elinor ' s countenance how much she really suffered , and a moment afterwards , alike distressed by Marianne ' s situation , knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention .\n",
      "\n",
      "18038: I happened to look up as I went by the chaise , and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele ; so I took off my hat , and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma ' am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr . Ferrars ' s , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they ' d make sure to come and see you .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "18039: \" But did she tell you she was married , Thomas ?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "18041: She smiled , and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts .\n",
      "\n",
      "18058: Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more .\n",
      "\n",
      "18062: \" Yes , ma ' am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady -- and she seemed vastly contented .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "18064: Marianne had already sent to say , that she should eat nothing more .\n",
      "\n",
      "18065: Mrs . Dashwood ' s and Elinor ' s appetites were equally lost , and Margaret might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced , so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals , she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before .\n",
      "\n",
      "18068: She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor ' s representation of herself ; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time , to spare her from an increase of unhappiness , suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne .\n",
      "\n",
      "18069: She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wont to believe , or than it was now proved to be .\n",
      "\n",
      "18070: She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor ;-- that Marianne ' s affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude .\n",
      "\n",
      "18072: She now found , that in spite of herself , she had always admitted a hope , while Edward remained single , that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy ; that some resolution of his own , some mediation of friends , or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady , would arise to assist the happiness of all .\n",
      "\n",
      "18073: But he was now married ; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery , which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence .\n",
      "\n",
      "18074: That he should be married soon , before ( as she imagined ) he could be in orders , and consequently before he could be in possession of the living , surprised her a little at first .\n",
      "\n",
      "18075: But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy , in her self - provident care , in her haste to secure him , should overlook every thing but the risk of delay .\n",
      "\n",
      "18078: They would soon , she supposed , be settled at Delaford .-- Delaford ,-- that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest ; which she wished to be acquainted with , and yet desired to avoid .\n",
      "\n",
      "18080: In Edward -- she knew not what she saw , nor what she wished to see ;-- happy or unhappy ,-- nothing pleased her ; she turned away her head from every sketch of him .\n",
      "\n",
      "18082: Though uncertain that any one were to blame , she found fault with every absent friend .\n",
      "\n",
      "18090: Scarcely had she so determined it , when the figure of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window .\n",
      "\n",
      "18093: Now she could hear more ; and she trembled in expectation of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "18095: Were it possible , she must say it must be Edward .\n",
      "\n",
      "18097: He had just dismounted ;-- she could not be mistaken ,-- it WAS Edward .\n",
      "\n",
      "18101: In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake .\n",
      "\n",
      "18103: She would have given the world to be able to speak -- and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness , no slight , would appear in their behaviour to him ;-- but she had no utterance , and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion .\n",
      "\n",
      "18109: Mrs . Dashwood , however , conforming , as she trusted , to the wishes of that daughter , by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing , met with a look of forced complacency , gave him her hand , and wished him joy .\n",
      "\n",
      "18111: Elinor ' s lips had moved with her mother ' s , and , when the moment of action was over , she wished that she had shaken hands with him too .\n",
      "\n",
      "18112: But it was then too late , and with a countenance meaning to be open , she sat down again and talked of the weather .\n",
      "\n",
      "18113: Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight , to conceal her distress ; and Margaret , understanding some part , but not the whole of the case , thought it incumbent on her to be dignified , and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could , and maintained a strict silence .\n",
      "\n",
      "18127: His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor , who sat with her head leaning over her work , in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was .\n",
      "\n",
      "18130: She almost ran out of the room , and as soon as the door was closed , burst into tears of joy , which at first she thought would never cease .\n",
      "\n",
      "18149: Mrs . Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both .\n",
      "\n",
      "18152: But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described ?-- From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil .\n",
      "\n",
      "18153: But when the second moment had passed , when she found every doubt , every solicitude removed , compared her situation with what so lately it had been ,-- saw him honourably released from his former engagement , saw him instantly profiting by the release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as constant as she had ever supposed it to be ,-- she was oppressed , she was overcome by her own felicity ;-- and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of tranquillity to her heart .\n",
      "\n",
      "18156: Lucy ' s marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all , formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers ;-- and Elinor ' s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard .\n",
      "\n",
      "18157: How they could be thrown together , and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration ,-- a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family -- it was beyond her comprehension to make out .\n",
      "\n",
      "18178: The independence she settled on Robert , through resentment against you , has put it in his power to make his own choice ; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a - year , to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do .\n",
      "\n",
      "18179: She will hardly be less hurt , I suppose , by Robert ' s marrying Lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "18190: In such a situation as that , where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature , how could I suppose , when she so earnestly , so warmly insisted on sharing my fate , whatever it might be , that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement ?\n",
      "\n",
      "18191: And even now , I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted , or what fancied advantage it could be to her , to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard , and who had only two thousand pounds in the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "18193: \" No ; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour ; that your own family might in time relent .\n",
      "\n",
      "18194: And at any rate , she lost nothing by continuing the engagement , for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions .\n",
      "\n",
      "18198: \" Your behaviour was certainly very wrong ,\" said she ; \" because -- to say nothing of my own conviction , our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT , as you were THEN situated , could never be .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "18211: But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs . Ferrars ' s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert ' s offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny .\n",
      "\n",
      "18221: Mrs . Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr . Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford .-- \" I do think ,\" she continued , \" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me .\n",
      "\n",
      "18223: came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs . Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world ;-- so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs . Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again .\n",
      "\n",
      "18230: Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs . Ferrars ; and even , if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son , his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter , nor be permitted to appear in her presence .\n",
      "\n",
      "18231: The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them , was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy ' s engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family .-- He thus continued : \" Mrs . Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward ' s name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion .\n",
      "\n",
      "18232: Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs . Ferrars ' s heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "18239: \" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "18242: CHAPTER 50 After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs . Ferrars , just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring , the reproach of being too amiable , Edward was admitted to her presence , and pronounced to be again her son .\n",
      "\n",
      "18244: For many years of her life she had had two sons ; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago , had robbed her of one ; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any ; and now , by the resuscitation of Edward , she had one again .\n",
      "\n",
      "18247: Mrs . Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power ;-- told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune ;-- and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE ; but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit -- and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor .\n",
      "\n",
      "18248: What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward ' s taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny .\n",
      "\n",
      "18252: Mrs . Jennings ' s prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas , and she found in Elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "18255: Mrs . Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed of having authorised ; and even the Dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour .\n",
      "\n",
      "18268: Instead of talking of Edward , they came gradually to talk only of Robert ,-- a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other , and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own ; and in short , it became speedily evident to both , that he had entirely supplanted his brother .\n",
      "\n",
      "18271: They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish ; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut -- and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages ;-- and from thence returning to town , procured the forgiveness of Mrs . Ferrars , by the simple expedient of asking it , which , at Lucy ' s instigation , was adopted .\n",
      "\n",
      "18273: But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages , in self - condemnation for Robert ' s offence , and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence .\n",
      "\n",
      "18281: Precious as was the company of her daughter to her , she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend ; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion - house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor .\n",
      "\n",
      "18283: With such a confederacy against her -- with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness -- with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself , which at last , though long after it was observable to everybody else -- burst on her -- what could she do ?\n",
      "\n",
      "18286: She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen , and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship , voluntarily to give her hand to another !-- and THAT other , a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment , whom , two years before , she had considered too old to be married ,-- and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat !\n",
      "\n",
      "18288: Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion , as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting ,-- instead of remaining even for ever with her mother , and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study , as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on ,-- she found herself at nineteen , submitting to new attachments , entering on new duties , placed in a new home , a wife , the mistress of a family , and the patroness of a village .\n",
