      "['EMMA\\nBY\\nJANE AUSTEN\\nVOLUME I\\nCHAPTER I\\nEmma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and\\nhappy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of\\nexistence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very\\nlittle to distress or vex her', \"\\nShe was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\\nindulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,\\nbeen mistress of his house from a very early period\", ' Her mother had\\ndied too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance\\nof her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman\\nas governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection', '\\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr', \" Woodhouse's family, less as a\\ngoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\\nof Emma\", ' Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters', \" Even\\nbefore Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,\\nthe mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any\\nrestraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they\\nhad been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,\\nand Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's\\njudgment, but directed chiefly by her own\", \"\\nThe real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having\\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\\nwell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\\nher many enjoyments\", ' The danger, however, was at present so\\nunperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with\\nher', '\\nSorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\\ndisagreeable consciousness', '--Miss Taylor married', \" It was Miss Taylor's\\nloss which first brought grief\", ' It was on the wedding-day of this\\nbeloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\\ncontinuance', ' The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father\\nand herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to\\ncheer a long evening', ' Her father composed himself to sleep after\\ndinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she\\nhad lost', '\\nThe event had every promise of happiness for her friend', ' Mr', \" Weston\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\\npleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with\\nwhat self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\\npromoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her\", ' The\\nwant of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day', ' She\\nrecalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen\\nyears--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five\\nyears old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her\\nin health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses of\\nchildhood', \" A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the\\nintercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect\\nunreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their being\\nleft to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection\", ' She had\\nbeen a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,\\nwell-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,\\ninterested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,\\nin every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak\\nevery thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as\\ncould never find fault', '\\nHow was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was going\\nonly half a mile from them;

and when the chances of his\\nmilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great\\nYorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was\\nsurprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and\\nwho were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend', '\\nMiss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\\nfortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the\\nfamily-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took\\nplace, to the infinite mortification of Mr', ' and Mrs', ' Churchill, who\\nthrew her off with due decorum', ' It was an unsuitable connexion, and\\ndid not produce much happiness', ' Mrs', ' Weston ought to have found more\\nin it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him\\nthink every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being\\nin love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not\\nthe best', \" She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of\\nher brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at\\nthat brother's unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her\\nformer home\", ' They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing\\nin comparison of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but\\nshe wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill\\nof Enscombe', \"\\nCaptain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\\nthe bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, he\\nwas rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain\", '\\nFrom the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved', \" The boy\\nhad, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\\nmother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr\", ' and Mrs', '\\nChurchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young\\ncreature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge\\nof the little Frank soon after her decease', ' Some scruples and some\\nreluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they\\nwere overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the\\ncare and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort\\nto seek, and his own situation to improve as he could', '\\nA complete change of life became desirable', ' He quitted the militia and\\nengaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\\nLondon, which afforded him a favourable opening', ' It was a concern\\nwhich brought just employment enough', ' He had still a small house in\\nHighbury, where most of his leisure days were spent;

among the most come-at-able of whom were\\nMrs', ' and Miss Bates, and Mrs', ' Goddard, three ladies almost always at\\nthe service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and\\ncarried home so often, that Mr', ' Woodhouse thought it no hardship for\\neither James or the horses', ' Had it taken place only once a year, it\\nwould have been a grievance', '\\nMrs', ' Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\\nlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille', ' She lived with\\nher single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all\\nthe regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\\ncircumstances, can excite', ' Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\\nof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married', '\\nMiss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\\nmuch of the public favour;

but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be\\nsupplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter\", \"\\nSuch was Jane Fairfax's history\", ' She had fallen into good hands, known\\nnothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent\\neducation', \" Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed\\npeople, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of\\ndiscipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in\\nLondon, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the\\nattendance of first-rate masters\", ' Her disposition and abilities were\\nequally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or\\nnineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the\\ncare of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself;\\nbut she was too much beloved to be parted with', ' Neither father nor\\nmother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it', ' The evil\\nday was put off', ' It was easy to decide that she was still too young;\\nand Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the\\nrational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of\\nhome and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering\\nsuggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this\\nmight soon be over', \"\\nThe affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell\\nin particular, was the more honourable to each party from the\\ncircumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and\\nacquirements\", ' That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen\\nby the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by\\nthe parents', ' They continued together with unabated regard however,\\ntill the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which\\nso often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction\\nto what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the\\naffections of Mr', ' Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as\\nsoon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled,\\nwhile Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn', '\\nThis event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\\nyet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\\nof duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had\\nfixed on for beginning', ' She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\\nshould be the period', ' With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she\\nhad resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire\\nfrom all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society,\\npeace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever', '\\nThe good sense of Colonel and Mrs', ' Campbell could not oppose such a\\nresolution, though their feelings did', ' As long as they lived, no\\nexertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and\\nfor their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this\\nwould be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon', '\\nPerhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have\\nresisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of\\nsuch enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished', '\\nStill, however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse\\nfor not hurrying on the wretched moment', \" She had never been quite well\\nsince the time of their daughter's marriage; and till she should have\\ncompletely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging\\nin duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame\\nand varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances,\\nto require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be\\ndischarged with tolerable comfort\", '\\nWith regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her\\naunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not\\ntold', ' It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to\\nHighbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with\\nthose kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,\\nwhatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double,\\nor treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that\\nthey depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the\\nrecovery of her health, than on any thing else', ' Certain it was that\\nshe was to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect\\nnovelty which had been so long promised it--Mr', \" Frank Churchill--must\\nput up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the\\nfreshness of a two years' absence\", '\\nEmma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like\\nthrough three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished,\\nand less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a\\ndifficult question to answer; Mr', ' Knightley had once told her it was\\nbecause she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she\\nwanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been\\neagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in\\nwhich her conscience could not quite acquit her', ' But \"she could never\\nget acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was\\nsuch coldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she\\npleased or not--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she\\nwas made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always\\nimagined that they were to be so intimate--because their ages were the\\nsame, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other', '\"\\nThese were her reasons--she had no better', \"\\nIt was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified\\nby fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\\nconsiderable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and\\nnow, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'\\ninterval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and\\nmanners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating\", '\\nJane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself\\nthe highest value for elegance', ' Her height was pretty, just such as\\nalmost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall;\\nher figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium,\\nbetween fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed\\nto point out the likeliest evil of the two', ' Emma could not but feel\\nall this; and then, her face--her features--there was more beauty in\\nthem altogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was\\nvery pleasing beauty', ' Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and\\neyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she\\nhad been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and\\ndelicacy which really needed no fuller bloom', ' It was a style of\\nbeauty, of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she\\nmust, in honour, by all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which,\\nwhether of person or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury', ' There,\\nnot to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit', '\\nIn short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with\\ntwofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering\\njustice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer', '\\nWhen she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her\\nbeauty; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to,\\nwhat she was going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed\\nimpossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if\\nto every well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added\\nthe highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr', ' Dixon, which\\nshe had so naturally started to herself', ' In that case, nothing could\\nbe more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had\\nresolved on', ' Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced\\nMr', \" Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which\\nher imagination had suggested at first\", ' If it were love, it might be\\nsimple, single, successless love on her side alone', ' She might have\\nbeen unconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his\\nconversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives,\\nmight now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to\\ndivide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon\\nbeginning her career of laborious duty', '\\nUpon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\\nas made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\\nafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that\\nshe could wish to scheme about for her', '\\nThese were charming feelings--but not lasting', ' Before she had\\ncommitted herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for\\nJane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and\\nerrors, than saying to Mr', ' Knightley, \"She certainly is handsome; she\\nis better than handsome!\" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with\\nher grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its\\nusual state', ' Former provocations reappeared', \" The aunt was as tiresome\\nas ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to\\nadmiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of\\nexactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how\\nsmall a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of\\nnew caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's\\noffences rose again\", ' They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the\\nthanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an\\naffectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off\\nin higher style her own very superior performance', ' She was, besides,\\nwhich was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no getting\\nat her real opinion', ' Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed\\ndetermined to hazard nothing', ' She was disgustingly, was suspiciously\\nreserved', '\\nIf any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved\\non the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing', ' She seemed\\nbent on giving no real insight into Mr', \" Dixon's character, or her own\\nvalue for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match\", ' It\\nwas all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or\\ndistinguished', ' It did her no service however', ' Her caution was thrown\\naway', ' Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises', '\\nThere probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference;\\nMr', ' Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the\\nother, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future\\ntwelve thousand pounds', '\\nThe like reserve prevailed on other topics', ' She and Mr', ' Frank\\nChurchill had been at Weymouth at the same time', ' It was known that\\nthey were a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information\\ncould Emma procure as to what he truly was', ' \"Was he handsome?\"--\"She\\nbelieved he was reckoned a very fine young man', '\" \"Was he agreeable?\"--\\n\"He was generally thought so', '\" \"Did he appear a sensible young man; a\\nyoung man of information?\"--\"At a watering-place, or in a common London\\nacquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points', ' Manners were\\nall that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than\\nthey had yet had of Mr', ' Churchill', ' She believed every body found his\\nmanners pleasing', '\" Emma could not forgive her', '\\nCHAPTER III\\nEmma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment\\nwere discerned by Mr', ' Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\\nseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was\\nexpressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with\\nMr', ' Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might\\nhave done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain\\nenough to be very intelligible to Emma', ' He had been used to think her\\nunjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement', '\\n\"A very pleasant evening,\" he began, as soon as Mr', ' Woodhouse had been\\ntalked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers\\nswept away;--\"particularly pleasant', ' You and Miss Fairfax gave us some\\nvery good music', \" I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than\\nsitting at one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such\\nyoung women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation\", ' I\\nam sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma', ' You\\nleft nothing undone', \" I was glad you made her play so much, for having\\nno instrument at her grandmother's, it must have been a real\\nindulgence\", '\"\\n\"I am happy you approved,\" said Emma, smiling; \"but I hope I am not\\noften deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield', '\"\\n\"No, my dear,\" said her father instantly; \"_that_ I am sure you are\\nnot', ' There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are', ' If any\\nthing, you are too attentive', ' The muffin last night--if it had been\\nhanded round once, I think it would have been enough', '\"\\n\"No,\" said Mr', ' Knightley, nearly at the same time; \"you are not often\\ndeficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension', ' I\\nthink you understand me, therefore', '\"\\nAn arch look expressed--\"I understand you well enough;\" but she said\\nonly, \"Miss Fairfax is reserved', '\"\\n\"I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome all\\nthat part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its\\nfoundation in diffidence', ' What arises from discretion must be\\nhonoured', '\"\\n\"You think her diffident', ' I do not see it', '\"\\n\"My dear Emma,\" said he, moving from his chair into one close by her,\\n\"you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant\\nevening', '\"\\n\"Oh!

and it was an agreeable surprize to her,\\ntherefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in\\narm', ' She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in\\ncompany with Mrs', ' Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him\\nwas to depend', ' If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends\\nfor it', ' But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied', '\\nIt was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid\\nhis duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole\\nmanner to her--nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of\\nconsidering her as a friend and securing her affection', ' And there was\\ntime enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit\\nincluded all the rest of the morning', ' They were all three walking\\nabout together for an hour or two--first round the shrubberies of\\nHartfield, and afterwards in Highbury', ' He was delighted with every\\nthing; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr', \" Woodhouse's ear; and when\\ntheir going farther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made\\nacquainted with the whole village, and found matter of commendation and\\ninterest much oftener than Emma could have supposed\", '\\nSome of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings', \" He\\nbegged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and\\nwhich had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting\\nthat an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest\\nof her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in\\nsome points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they\\nshewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must\\nbe very like a merit to those he was with\", '\\nEmma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it\\ncould not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily\\nabsenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a\\nparade of insincere professions; and that Mr', ' Knightley certainly had\\nnot done him justice', '\\nTheir first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though\\nthe principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses\\nwere kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any\\nrun on the road;

and but for the sense of his\\nson-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm every\\nnight of his life\", ' The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of\\nthe Mr', ' Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence', ' While either of\\nthem protected him and his, Hartfield was safe', '-- But Mr', ' John\\nKnightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in\\nNovember', '\\nThe result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the\\nmoment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr', ' Elton was called\\non, within a month from the marriage of Mr', ' and Mrs', ' Robert Martin, to\\njoin the hands of Mr', ' Knightley and Miss Woodhouse', '\\nThe wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have\\nno taste for finery or parade; and Mrs', ' Elton, from the particulars\\ndetailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very\\ninferior to her own', '--\"Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a\\nmost pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it', '\"--But,\\nin spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence,\\nthe predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the\\nceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union', '\\nFINIS\\n']\n",
